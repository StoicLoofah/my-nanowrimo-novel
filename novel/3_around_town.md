3. Around Town
=======================

Yannhorn, Darella, and Mareak sat in the reception of the sideways tower. Feenious was still in the room but remained fixated on the Ruby of Eternal Light.

"So what can this Ruby do?" asked Yannhorn.

"We saw it fuel that plant monstrosity back in the dungeon." said Darella. "Clearly that eternal light is not just a fancy torch."

"Monstrosity? That might be the harshest thing I have ever heard you say about a plant."

"Despite being made of plant matter, it was truly unnatural and an abomination of nature. The magic that emanates from the Ruby twists life in a way offensive to druids like myself." Darella turned to address Feenious. "Perhaps that twisted magic is why you sent us for it?"

"Indeed. Do you not remember the legend I told you about it?" The party nodded, and Feenious sighed. "Well, I guess I can explain again. The demon Malafar is not native to the material plane, and to maintain his presence here, he must constantly find new sources of energy."

"Like that lamp we destroyed? And that headless chicken we chased across the continent?"

"Yes, just like that," Feenious said unapologetically. "Well, this Ruby was originally imbued by a king who wanted strength at any cost. You have seen the effect that the Ruby has on beings that originate on this plane; you can only imagine what it would do to beings that originated in the same place as itself.

"This happens to be the last major source of demonic energy I am aware of on this continent. As such, I believe that we have forced Malafar's hand: his time on this plane is now quite limited, and if he truly seeks to destroy us all, it will happen soon."

Mareak cheered. "The end is in sight! We can become the heroes of this realm! What's left to do?"

"I need more time to answer that question," replied Feenious. "I believe you will need to face him soon, but without preparation, you may not be ready. I have consulted with ancient tomes, and it appears that you will need to gather important relics into battle with you. I can tell you more about it soon. Please, return tomorrow morning, and I will have more ideas for you."

The party arrived in Ryden by midday and were looking to relax for the rest of the day before continuing their adventure the next day. They went to the Hungry Rabbit, their favorite inn with the best beef stew in the kingdom.

When they opened the door, they were greeted with the smell of freshly baked bread and the murmur of a few patrons eating.

"Ahoy! There ye be," called out a portly man behind the counter. "What be your fancy today?"

"Hi Brickboard," said Darella. "We'll be staying the night, but first, we would love to have lunch. What are you serving today?"

"Only the best! Leek soup, bread, a mead sweet as candy." Brickboard leaned over the counter with a big grin on his face. Seeing nods from all of the party, he waved over to a server. "Aye. Jimmy'll take care of ye. Leave yer things and sit."

"Do you think we'll need our gear today?" asked Yannhorn as he dropped his sack to the ground. "I swear, we only end up disarming when there are assassins around."

"I have no worries," replied Mareak who began to remove his armor. "Still, I plan to keep my dagger on me." Yannhorn shrugged and untied his sword sheath.

Soon, the party was sitting comfortably, laughing at bad jokes over far too much mead. By then, it had reached early afternoon, and the market would be closing soon.

By the time they arrived at the market, it was bustling with daily commerce and last minute deals. Carts lined the town square with linens, meats, jewelry, leather, sacks of grains, and more. Merchants bartered with each other, common workers, and nobles in their typically loud and harsh manner. As usual, the town guard wandered through their patrol without a care and doing little to prevent thieves from doing their usual business as well.

"I need to gather and refill my spell reagents," said Darella as she scanned the vendors in front of her. "What do you two need?"

"I need another set of tools and a new dagger," replied Mareak. He glared at Yennhorn who completely ignored it. "I can go with you into the market and make contact there."

Darella went from shop to shop and bargained for various powders and animal parts. Meanwhile, Yennhorn held off the wandering fingers of children, a task made easier by his halfling height. Mareak was making hand gestures to others wandering through the market and also seemed to be gathering supplies without meeting any of the merchants.

"Are we done?" asked Darella after making her final purchase. The others nodded while looking at the remaining shops for anything they may have forgotten. As they thought it over, the ground began to shake. They looked back at each other, and Yannhorn sighed.

"I cannot believe you convinced me to disarm."

---

The shaking became more and more intense. Although the crowd had thinned from earlier in the day, those remaining began to panic and look for cover. Shop tents began to fall, and merchants scrambled for their wares. The party, however, pushed forward towards the most violent shaking.

Just as quickly as it had started, the shaking stopped, and for a few seconds, heads began popping up again. The calm was then broken as shards of stone and earth erupted from the middle of the market. From it came small reptilian humanoids with javelins, torches, and bows. The first wave threw fire into the crowd, and canopies caught fire.

"Mareak, think about looting later," said Yennhorn. Mareak waited for an explanation. "If these kobolds run wild, there won't be anyone to take from." Mareak thought, shrugged, then pulled out his dagger and ran towards the fissure. 

Yannhorn looked around for a weapon, but amidst the chaos, he couldn't see any of the weapon shops. He too shrugged and ran into battle.

Darella looked into her pouch and thought through the spells she had prepared to cast. Also unready for combat, she shrugged and ran forward.

Yannhorn came across a pack of kobolds fighting with several members of the town guard. Despite their heavy armor, the guards seemed unable to deal with the kobolds, who easily danced around the wild sword swings. As one guard brought his arm back to slice again, Yannhorn kicked him in the back of the leg and grabbed the sword out of his hand. The long sword took two hands for him to wield, but he finished kicking the guard member into the gound, leap over him, and caught the kobold before him in a hard hit.

"Let the professionals handle this," he said back to the guard. Thinking on this a moment, he corrected himself. "Okay, technically you're the professional. Still, let us handle this. You go help everyone else."

Mareak, moving just as swiftly as the kobolds, engaged with three of them and danced between their javelin jabs. He systematically hit each with minor but painful stabs and left them all incapacitated. 

Seeing an unarmed female, several of the kobolds broke off to attack Darella, but as they charged, she began to charge at them. As she sped towards them, she leaned forward and her face began dark and more angular. She then leapt forward and in mid-air, her body lengthened out into the shape of a wolf. Pouncing on one kobold, she knocked it to the ground and attacked with her claws. By the time she was done, the other kobolds had scattered. Yannhorn ran over to her.

"Nice trick. We need a plan," said Yannhorn. Mareak ran over to join them. "If you see any town guard, tell them to get everyone out of here and engage only if necessary." Looking over at the fissure, he saw more kobolds pouring out. "Darella, you're the fastest. Just hunt and try to keep them contained." She nodded. "Mareak, you're with me: let's go for the source and see if we can stop any more from coming."

Darella turned and launched herself at the nearest pack of kobolds, who were threatening in an incense merchant. Yannhorn and Mareak began to fight their way through the kobolds. As scary as their scales and red glowing eyes were, the kobolds weren't bold enough to face these two experienced adventurers. Working solidly as a team, they cut down at least a dozen kobolds each before reaching the fissure.

As they neared the fissure, they noticed a red glow, and when they pushed up to the edge, there was no tunnel and ladder leading up. There was simply a large, fiery portal, which kobolds were being launched out of.

"I have no idea how we stop that," said Mareak. Falling back into a ready stance, they fought with the kobolds as they came out of the portal. "I hope you can think while you're fighting." Yannhorn simply grunted back a response and continued to fight.

Darella pursued kobolds as they scampered through the market, and though she was ready to fight, she found most of them running away through the city. Chasing them up and down alleys, she encountered guards barring gates and ushering commoners to safety. When she could see no more kobolds, she stopped and began to transform back into human form.

"You. Guard. Hey!" she yelled. A town guard turned to look at her while waving people into a building behind him. "What's going on? Where did the kobolds go?"

"I know not, milady," he responded politely. "I saw a large group of them moving towards the north side, but what they plan, I cannot say." She thought for a moment, then nodded in appreciation and ran back towards the market.

She met up with the others near the fissue and looked down into the portal.

"I take it neither of you know what to do about that," she said.

"I know this and only this," said Yannhorn who waved his sword as a reference and pointed at the kobolds lying around him.

"That's good enough. Please step back from the portal and keep that up," she said. Once again, she reached into her pouch and found a vial of water. Shifting into a safe spot close to Yannhorn, she opened the vial and poured it into the ground beneath her. She began to chant and pressed her hands to the earth.

Yannhorn felt the earth beneath him began to shift again, but when he looked down, he saw it sliding, not shaking. The earth turned wet beneath his feet, and it began to slowly sink towards the fissure. He swung at another kobold, then looked back at Darella, clearly alarmed.

"Okay, that spell was very effective. Everybody run!" Darella took off away from the portal, and Mareak disengaged with a kobold and backed away.

Yannhorn shoved the kobold to the ground, but when he tried to step away, his foot felt glued, and he fell face first into the mud. He tried to call for help but only managed to blow bubbles into the ground.

Clawing his way up, Yannhorn let go of his sword and tried to push himself up and forward. Stumbling again, he found himself on a downward slide. He looked behind him and saw the flames of the portal coming closer.

He then heard a splash beside him and saw the braid of a thin rope in the mud. Without thinking, he grabbed it and started pulling himself up. As he climbed, he saw kobold bodies floating past him. Soon, he felt solid ground beneath him, found his footing, then ran the rest of the way up, where he saw Mareak reeling in the other end of the rope.

"I literally never go anywhere without rope after that mine rescue thing," Mareak said. The three of them looked in towards the fissure, which now only half visible under the mud. Mareak turned to Darella and said, "I did not know that 'Make Mud' was a druid spell."

"Maybe not, but 'Make Water' is, and that was a lot of water." Darella looked down proudly at her work as the mud continued to rush in, leaving a sizable crater in the middle of the square. Suddenly realizing the situation, however, she looked back up at the others. "A guard told me that they kobolds were headed for the north side. My guess is that they're going for the Temple of the Moon. Let's go."

---

The party arrived at the Temple of the Moon quickly, but the entire area around it was deserted.

"There are usually guards here, right?" asked Darella.

"Yeah, but they're not particularly good." Mareak paused. "Not like I would know, or anything. Just a guess. Let's just go in."

The Temple had a giant crescent sculpture mounted atop a pyramid made of white marble. They hurried up to the temple and arrived at a smaller gate intended for the lower class worshippers. Mareak gestured for the others to wait. He silently ducked in through the gate and turned a corner past the view of the others.

Mareak reappeared a minute or two later while Yannhorn was still picking bits of mud and dirt off of his body.

"I saw maybe 10 kobolds in there. I didn't see any of the priests, so I guess they probably managed to lock them up somewhere as hostages. I couldn't quite make out what they were doing, but they weren't in there just for rampage. These guys looked much tougher, and I think they're on a mission: they were all standing around some fountain."

"I think you're probably referring to the Pool of Tears," replied Darella, who was met with blank stares. "Neither of you know the story, do you?

"The Temple of the Moon is the most important holy site in the city. Shermish lore claimed that Shermland was originally created and blessed by the lady of the moon itself, and her tears formed the series of lakes that made Shermland so beautiful. The first priests gathered the purest of the water to stored here."

"Okay, thanks for the history lesson, but that doesn't explain this situation" said Yannhorn. "Why would the kobolds want to do anything with it?"

Darella wrinkled her brow, then spoke. "Well, it is a source of spiritual energy and focus for Ryden. I can't say what would happen without it, but it probably wouldn't be good. This attack wasn't just a raid: that portal was too fancy, and the attack on the market was a distraction for this."

"I have a suggestion: we run in and kick some kobold butt. We can plan, but we're just letting the kobolds do more kobold things," said Mareak. He looked noble for a moment, but then explained. "Maybe this doesn't really benefit me, but I try not to cross the gods when I can."

Agreed, they crept into the temple and moved towards the room of the Pool of Tears. They quickly and quietly eliminated the kobolds standing guard at the entrance to the room and peered in. 

Inside, they could see the circular pool in the middle of the room with kobolds all around it. The pool itself threw light in ripples all across the room as if lit from underneath, illuminating the marble pillars and walls around it.

"Okay, we attack. Just please try not to let anything fall into the pool and taint it." The others nodded, then Yannhorn yelled a war cry and charged into the room.

The kobolds turned to face him, and though neither the war cry nor his stature nor his hygiene alarmed them, they did notice the long sword he held, and half of them turned to face him with their own swords.

Mareak ran in behind him, and Darella behind that, and in the middle of the room near the edge of the pool, they met and struck back and forth at each other. While the previous kobolds had gone down without much effort, these kobolds swung harder and moved faster. Still, the 4 kobolds were steadily being pushed back and injured through the battle. Mareak cut down one, and Darella knocked down another with her bare hands, but the rest of the kobolds then joined the battle.

Seeing the enemies, Yannhorn yelled a "stand back!" at his partners, then swung his sword into a ready position. He swung it back across his body in a wide cut that missed the kobolds, but then he turned and continued the swing. He spun around and around, and his blade formed a dangerous spinning whirl. The kobolds began backing up, but he accelerated, and he took out the rest of the kobolds on the spot.

"I was wondering when you would use your whirlwind," Mareak said catching back up to Yannhorn, who now lay on his back, very dizzy. "It didn't look as tight as usual."

"Too much mead," explained Yannhorn. "Go find the priests. I'll be right here."

Mareak and Darella left the room, and soon, they came back with a group of very appreciative priests. Several of them went to the kobold bodies to remove them from the room, but others knelt by the pool.

"So what did you say that had done?" asked one older woman. She flipped the hood of her robes down and looked deep into the water.

"I have no idea," replied Darella. She looked back to the pool and gazed at her lit reflection, when she heard a scream of pain to her right.

Everyone in the room froze and looked over to see a younger priest with his arm over the pool, but with no hand left on the end of it. Instead, there was a white froth on the end of the stump, and he pulled it back in pain.

The old priest looked back to Darella and said, "We of the lady of the moon greatly appreciate what you have done, but you may have in fact been too late. You cannot help any longer, and I must ask you to leave."

Yennhorn got to his feet and hurried out with the three of them, not looking back at the pool.

---

"Oh aye, what an afternoon," said Brickboard as the three adventurers slunk back into the the Hungry Rabbit. "Knowing ye three, there was no relaxin' today." They all shook their heads.

"We'll take dinner up in our sitting room. We're headed out early tomorrow morning," said Yennhorn. "Don't disturb us unless a priest comes by."
