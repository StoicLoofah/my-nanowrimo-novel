11. Conflict of Beliefs
=======================

"I think our best approach is to be open-minded," said Darella. "We really just need to get in and hopefully not get hurt, so I think we should go with a diplomatic solution. We can go up to the guards, ask forgiveness, and try to get in to see Ramalamakama."

Yannhorn corrected Darella, "First, his name is Lamaramakama. And second, I think it's ridiculous to hope for a diplomatic solution. Count me out of all of this." Yannhorn abruptly got up and wandered away.

"That's okay; let him go," Mareak said. "We can do this ourselves, and we'll just cut his part of the payment when we get back." Darella nodded in agreement. "So we'll just imagine that the whole place is really poorly organized, and Lamaramakama will walk out to meet us."

"Not quite," said Hannah. "Remember, if multiple beliefs conflict, then yours may not come to fruition."

"Thanks for the reminder," Mareak replied. He stared down at the pink-purple castle and squinted to make out details. " We could plan out something extensive, but I think circumstances will be very different from what we try, and that will all change as we walk through. Let's just go for it and hope that we're stronger than Lamaramakama expects."

Mareak and Darella walked towards the castle with Hannah flying along behind them. They moved silently and all tried to focus their thoughts on positive outcomes. At the drawbridge, they saw 2 figures standing ready in full plate mail armor. Each had a pike upright in their right hand and a shield in their left. As the party approached, neither guard moved.

"Heya guys," Mareak said. They didn't respond, and he kept walking forward. "Look, we're hear to see Lamaramakama, so it would be great if you could just–"

Before Mareak could cross the threshold between the guards and the drawbridge, the guards moved their pikes into a cross, barring his entrance. Mareak stopped just short then backed up.

"Okay, be cool," he said. "What's it going to take to get us inside?"

"To pass, you must answer our riddle," said one of the guards. The voice echoed from within the suit of armor. "What creature has 4 feet in the morning, 2 feet in the afternoon, and 3 feet in the evening?"

Darella rolled her eyes. "Well, this is obvious. It might literally be the oldest riddle ever. The answer is 'man'."

"Incorrect," the guard replied. "The answer is the multi-legged chameleon of the astral plane. You may not pass."

"Wow, you just got stung," said Mareak. Darella stood aghast and blinked several times in disbelief. "What are we going to do now?"

Darella began pacing. Mareak tried several times to sneak past the guards, but they turned him back each time, though they did not obviously become any more perturbed than the previous time.

Abruptly, Darella stopped and walked up to one of the guards. "Hello! Anyone in there?", she yelled in its face. The guard didn't move. She moved slowly towards the guard, who didn't flinch. Gently, she reached up to its visor and flipped it open. Inside, there was nothing.

"That is spooky," Mareak said.

"I thought as much," Darella replied. "These guards aren't other beings. They're just constructs of imaginations: no more real or fake than the rest of this castle. Clearly, it is not our own imagination that created this riddle as a pass, or else we would have gotten it right." She began to pace again in thought. "And I guess their current form indicates that someone, probably Lamaramakama, is combating our own will."

"So we can't just will them away," said Mareak. Darella shook her head and him, then continued to pace. "What can we do?"

"Clearly, we cannot break past the guards with an opposing perspective," she replied. "But... but there are limits. Presumably, there are limits on the detail to which imagination becomes real, so if we can just twist the details slightly, then maybe we can get another shot."

"If I'm following you," Mareak began, "then we need to come up with something similar to a riddle to keep it close to Lamaramakama's imagination, but just different enough that we can pass." Darella nodded again, and Hannah began to quiver with excitment. "So, what, like a joke contest?"

"What's black and white and red all over?" one of the guards said. Mareak and Darella looked at each other in triumph and high-fived.

"A newspaper!" Darella yelled and laughed. "What's red, fluffy, covered in chocolate, and orbits the sun?"

The guards were silent for a moment, then one spoke. "A Mars baaa." The guards rattled with amusement. "How many clerics does it take to screw in a light bulb?"

"One," said Mareak, "to cast 'Cure Light'. How many blonds does it take to screw in a lightbulb?"

"Three," replied a guard. Then in unison, they delivered the punchline, "one to hold the bulb and two to turn the ladder." The guards were silent for a few seconds, then continued the context. "Why do golfers carry extra socks?"

Darella and Mareak were silent and deep in thought.

"I don't think I know this one," Mareak whispered to Darella. She shook her head back at him, and they stood and smiled at guards while they continued to think.

"I got this one," Hannah then jumped in. "Because they always get a hole in one!" Everyone burst out in laughter. After recovering, Hannah turned back to the party. "Got another joke?" Everyone became silent again.

"I have a winner here," said Darella, taking a deep breath. "Why was six afraid of seven?"

"Because 'seven eight nine'!", one of the guards said, and they began then rattle again.

"Hah! You're wrong!", Darella exclaimed. The guards quieted down and awaited an explanation.

"Because," Darella began, "seven was a known 'six offender'."

The guards were silent again, and Mareak gritted his teeth. Then, the guards began to rattle again.

"You win!" one cried. "You may pass," said the other. Everyone laughed, and the guards raised their pikes to unbar the way. With the path clear, the party walked onward, over the drawbridge, and into the castle.

---

The castle was quiet when the party walked in. The courtyard was empty, but directly ahead was the keep. Although it didn't appear to be particularly wide, the keep rose for many floors. As their eyes wandered upwards, they saw a window near the top, where a green figure poked its head out.

"Welcome!" Lamaramakama cried. He waved three of his four hands out of the window. "I see you have made it into my home. And you have also brought my fairy home to me. Welcome back, my dear!"

Hannah cooed, then flew up towards Lamaramakama and away from the party. She flew in through the window and disappeared.

"Yeah, we're glad to see you, too," said Mareak. "Look, I'm sorry I lied about our role here earlier, but we're pretty desparate. We're not joking about the part where we care a lot about our plane staying intact and needing whatever you took to make things better."

"Now, now," Lamaramakama said, shaking the mass of his body roughly around his head. "I know you're still not being entirely honest with me: I can feel it in my plane. That may be Darella's true goal, but Mareak, I know you're in this for the wealth and personal gain. If you could imagine success without the material plane, you might choose that instead."

"That–," Mareak cut himself off. "Okay, that's fair. But it's still a mostly true statement."

"As you pointed out, I believe it," Darella said. "Please, this is very important to us, and we even need to find our other companion before we leave."

Lamaramakama continued to look down at them with a large grin. He tapped the side of his head-like area with one of his fingers, then spoke. "Okay. You can have it if you can get it. But you're still down there, and I'm up here, and there's a lot of imagination between us. Please, be my guest to earn back the existence of the material plane." With that, Lamaramakama ducked back in the window.

"Well, there goes our guide. It's just you and me," Darella said. Mareak offered a fist bump, which Darella took. "So, do you see an entrance to the keep anywhere?"

"No," Mareak replied, "but I think there's one on the backside, probably minimally protected. Let's take a look."

The two walked around the keep clockwise. Mareak reached out to touch the wall, and though it was not as solid as stone, it felt hard to the touch, unlike the ground beneath him. On the back side of the keep, they found a door as predicted. Darella approached the door and reached out towards the handle, but Mareak put his arm in front of her to stop her.

"Wait," he said. "Please, since when do we _just_ open doors? Allow the rogue to go to work." 

Darella backed away from the door. Mareak kneeled up close to the door and looked carefully at the handle. To the average onlooker, it appeared normal, but up close, Mareak could see the slightest twinkle to it. He backed away and began fishing around in his pack.

"I think it's electrically charged," he said. "Our best bet is to ground it to neutralize the trap." From his pack, he found a length of rope-like wire. He took one end and buried it partway under the ground into the pink-purple. With the other, he formed a loop, which he began to swing around like a lasso. In one smooth motion, he tossed and released the loop towards the door. When the loop caught on the handle, they heard a "zap" in the air, and the wire smoked slightly.

"Good work," Darella said as Mareak began to reel the line in. He formed a coil again, threw it back into his pack, then approached the door. He grabbed the handle without hesitation and opened the door. 

Behind it was complete darkness. Despite the ambient light, there was a hard threshold behind which everything was black. Mareak moved his hand forward through the darkness, and as it crossed the door frame, his hand disappeared. He moved it back and forth, and though he couldn't feel anything, something was happening.

"Have you ever seen anything like this?" Darella asked him. She walked up to the opening and ran her hand forward and backwards as well.

"Beats me," Mareak replied. "It's moments like this when I wish I had chosen to become a wizard instead of a rogue. Do you hear that, though?" Without moving through, he moved his ear closer to the black threshold.

Darella sidled up as well. "Yeah, I think so. It sounds like tavern music. Should we go in?"

"Could be dangerous," Mareak said. "You first." Darella turned to look at Mareak, but he was already pushing her forward, and he followed immediately after.

---

Inside, Darella and Mareak were standing in a loud tavern. Behind them, the door shut, and when Darella went for the handle, the door didn't move.

"This is most surprising," Mareak said. He walked forward slowly and scoped out the room. There were roughly 50 people at the tables and bar, and though they all appeared to lively and enjoying their company, he couldn't distinctly make out a single converation. "This tavern is some sort of creation of our imagination. The people in here feel roughly correct, but individually, they're speaking gibberish."

Darella walked up close to a dwarf and human laughing over a drink, and though she moved close enough to eat the chicken leg on the table, they didn't react and continued their conversation. "Look at this," she said, pointing to the dwarf. "He's drinking, but the amount of liquid in his cup isn't changing. I don't know if there's an intelligent being in this room other than myself."

Mareak walked up to the stage where several performers were playing and surveyed the entire room. Darella walked through the tables several more times before joining Mareak. "Well, this is supposed to be a test, right?", Mareak asked. "Do you see anything unusual around here? Anything that may be our next step?"

"No, and believe me, I'm trying to imagine something more interesting. There is the door back there, presumably to the kitchen," she pointed out. "Let's try that."

They approached the kitchen door, but before opening it, they heard a voice cry out above the rest of the din. They looked back to see the bartender leaning over the bar and looking at them.

"Hey! You!" he said. "No going back there! That's off limits!" Darella and Mareak looked at the portly bartender who stared intensely at them behind a thick, red beard.

"I think we might have found our exception," Mareak said to Darella, and they walked up to the bar. "Good evening," he said to the bartender. "The lady and I will each have a pint of your most popular brew."

The bartender looked at them suspiciously, then reached over for mugs without breaking eye contact with Mareak. "Who are you, anyways?" Mareak began to speak, but Darella cleared her throat.

"Let me handle this one," she said to him. She turned to the bartender and said, "I'm Darella, and this is Mareak. We're not from this plane, but I imagine that you are. We're here because Lamaramakama has something that we need."

The bartender took a deep breath, then began to fill the mugs. "Well, consider yourselves lucky. If you still think that you can find him, you must be new."

"New?", she looked at Mareak, who shrugged at the comment. "Yes, I suppose we are, though the way you phrased that suggested that you are not."

"Certainly not," he replied. "I have been here for what feels like months. Well, not _here_ here. Every once in awhile, I find myself in some new strange setting and just have to adapt. I mean, do I look like a bartender to you?" Neither Darella nor Mareak replied, though they both took the drinks he pushed to them.

"So what brought you here? And is anyone else here?"

The bartender leaned over the bar and spoke more quietly. "Why I'm here isn't important anymore. And I don't see many people pass through other than some of Lamaramakama's goons. All I know is that that kitchen is bad news, and other than that, I think this place is a trap. I have been in this tavern for days now."

"Well, I might as well enjoy it," Mareak said. He tipped his mug and took a long drink. He set it back down again, and it was empty. "Wow, that's amazing," he said. Can I have another?"

The bartender took the mug and refilled it. "No problem. As far as I can tell, you won't need to pay for any of this." He passed the drink back to Mareak, who began to drink quickly again. "How were you planning on getting out of here? I still haven't figured this place out."

"Well, I think this is all a game of imagination and willpower," Darella replied. "Unfortunately, it's kind of hard to imagine a way out when that's exactly what our adversary is trying to prevent. And to be frank, the richness of this scene makes it hard to imagine anything different." Mareak pushed his mug back across to the bartender unsteadily. The bartender complied and began to fill it again.

"Well that isn't helpful at all," the bartender replied. "Believe me, as boring as this place is, it's hard to shake. I have tried to talk to everyone in this room. Twice. And it hasn't changed at all."

"Another," Mareak said, pushing his mug back to the bartender as he swayed back and forth.

"Not today, buddy," the bartender said. He took the mug and put it behind the bar. "You are too drunk too quickly."

"No, yooouuu are too crunked too drickly," Mareak said pointing with his left hand. The bartender stared back and him, and Darella laughed quietly. Mareak glared at the bartender for a moment, then brought his arm back, bumping the patron next to him with his elbow.

"Hey, that, that was rude to hit me," said Mareak. He turned to the burly man next to him, who remained completely unfazed by the elbow or threat. "Hey, loook at me," Mareak said. He poked the man in the shoulder, which also elicited no response.

"Mareak, he's not going to react," Darella said gently.

"No, this guy, he wants to fight," Mareak yelled back. "I can see that he wants to fight. Fight me man!" The man was about to take another drink when Mareak threw a punch straight to his face.

Darella giggled, but then stopped when she realized that the entire tavern had gone silent. She looked back at the room, where everyone was staring at Mareak. The burly man he had hit stood up and turned to Mareak. He stared at the drunken elf standing in front of him, then very mechanically swung his arm back and punched at Mareak.

Mareak took the blow in the side of his jaw and went flying into a circle of gnomes. As he shook off the blow and looked up, he saw the man taking awkward steps towards him.

"Uh oh," the bartender said as he ducked behind the bar. 

Darella quickly assessed the scene, but instead of restraining the man marching towards her companion, she looked at the waitress standing next to her. She grabbed the platter of mugs she was carrying and flung them into the crowd.

"BAR FIGHT!" Mareak cried, and in an instant, the entire cavern turned to chaos. Conversations turned to boxing matches, shards of broken glasses flew everywhere, and the rumble of conversation turned into screams and crashes.

Mareak staggered back to his feet in the time it took the man to wade through the crowd towards him. The man punched straight at him, but at the last second, Mareak swooned out of the way. The man took several more swings, each of which Marek narrowly dodged by twisting and rolling his body. 

"Darellaaa! Darellaaa! What's our exit strategy?" he called out, staggering left and right to avoid attacks.

She looked around the bar again for some way to change the situation again. On the other side of the room, she saw several of the patrons twitching strangely in the back. "Mareak, I think this tavern might be breaking down!"

"That's the idea," he said as he hopped back and sucked in his stomach. "Can do you more of that?"

She ducked as a mug flew over her head, then noticed the cooking fire in the corner. Keeping her head down, she weaved through the fight up to the fire and saw the coals burning within. She closed her eyes and tried to focus on the image of the coals in front of her. Shutting out the sounds around her, she began to chant.

The coals began to shoot out of the pit and into the tavern. Some hit unfortunate patrons while some just left trails of burning embers. Others hit linen or alcohol lying around, and started to burn.

Darella opened her eyes to see the fires slowly gaining momentum. She heard a "faster!" somewhere amidst the battle and felt the need to continue pressing. She took a deep breath and exhaled slowly. She took another deep breath, then exhaled. She took a third breath, but as she exhaled this time, a gust of wind came from her mouth, and the fires that had began suddenly erupted.

Mareak looked at the tavern around him: instead of the jolly evening from before, he saw a huge battle, debris flying everywhere, and flames engulfing everything. He let out a hoot and turned back to his assailant just in time to see a fist coming for his face. He was one again lifted off the ground and flew back several feet.

And landed on the cold, hard, damp stones of a prison cell.

---

"Hey, is that you guys?" a voice called. 

Mareak sat up and rubbed his jaw. The prison cell was barely lit by a small window several feet off the ground, and he could see a rolling pink-purple landscape outside. It cast a strange light about the prison cell, and he could barely make out various people chained against the wall.

Darella stood next to him and helped Mareak to his feet. "Who said that?", she called out. 

"Guys, it's me," the voice said again. "It's Yannhorn."

They rushed over to the corner where they heard the voice, and up close, they could see the unmistakeable stature and features of the halfling in shackles against the wall.

"Unbelievable!", Darella said. "How did you end up in here? Wait a second: how do we know it's you?"

Yannhorn thought for a second. "Uh, well, I am right here. It kind of has to be me, right?"

Mareak pondered this point for a moment, then agreed. "Good point. Well, I'm glad to see you here. Wait just a second: I'll get my tools out and get you free."

"Don't even bother trying," Yannhorn replied. He shook the chain on his left hand. "I looked it over, and I don't see a lock anywhere. They must have welded me in or something."

"Hmm," Mareak said. He ran his fingers over the length of the chain. "Looks like you're right. I guess we'll just have to blast our way out of this dream."

"Hah!", a voice called from the darkness. "Like you'll ever figure that one out." The voice was filled with the cynicism of an old man.

"We got out of a tavern," Mareak retorted.

"What, you got out of a tavern?" Yannhorn asked. "Why does my imagination look so terrible?"

Darella gave him a pat on the head. "Bad luck, I guess? As a summary, we were just in some bizarro tavern where everything was totally normal except no one was sentient other than the bartender. Mareak had the great idea to tear the place apart to break the reality completely. Question, though: how are you sober right now?"

Mareak shook his head and shrugged. "No idea. But I think that was pretty important: I feel like my thoughts were far less inhibited after downing those drinks."

"That's nothing," called out the voice again. "I beat the tavern in ten minutes. This place? I have been here from 10 years. And I have never seen the jailer. Maybe the prison is physically isn't real, but it sure is mentally real."

The party looked at each other with concern.

"Well that's grim," Mareak said. "Any thoughts on how we're going to get out?" The party was silent. Mareak twirled a lockpick between his fingers while Darella looked down into the puddle beneath her.

"I guess the difference this time," Yannhorn added, "is that you have me now. You guys already had your test back at the tavern. I think this place is mine to figure out."

"Thanks for stepping up," Mareak said. "Unfortunately, you also happen to be the one chained to the wall. This seems pretty difficult."

"No, I think that's part of the point," Yannhorn said. "These," he said while shaking the chains, "are physical. My problem so far with this plane has been all mental: I don't have the will or confidence or whatever to assert reality how I need it. So let's work through this."

"Okay, what do you want to work through?" asked Darella. She sat on the ground in front of Yannhorn. He shrugged.

"How about your recent performance problems?" called out the voice from the darkness.

"I hope we're still talking about the adventure," Yannhorn said with a straight face. The other two snickered, and Yannhorn waited for them to quiet down. "Okay, let's start with the performance problems. I couldn't conjure up anything when we wandered around this plane. That was pretty wimpy."

"Meh," Mareak replied and waved off the concern. "I'm not too worried. It happens sometimes. We have it covered."

"See, I guess that's the problem," Yannhorn quickly said, then retreated. He sat silently.

"What's the problem?", Darella asked after a few seconds.

Yannhorn didn't respond immediately. He looked up at Darella, then back down. "I feel like I'm not contributing to the team like you guys are. I can't conjure plants to fix everything. I can't dance with a gnoll to win respect. What I can do is slip in the mud and fail to fight off a mosquito, and then make a snarky comment about it."

"Woah, way to cut yourself short," said Mareak. "I'm pretty sure you whirlwinded to take out the kobold commandos. You also led our charge on the gnoll scouts. That's pretty impressive."

"Geez, that stuff was just luck," Yannhorn said with disdain. "Thank goodness I managed to not get smashed too badly in those battles."

"And that's where you're discounting yourself," said Darella. She leaned in to emphasize and empathize. "There is naturally variance in this world, and it's unfair to yourself and your abilities if you credit the good to luck and the bad to a lack of talent. It's all a roll of the dice anyways."

"Whatever," Yannhorn replied, unconvinced. "Look, I really appreciate what you guys are trying to do here, but as I said, I need to figure out this problem."

"That's what we're doing right now," Mareak added. He was crouching on one knee and rubbed his jaw again. "Maybe you don't have the most glamorous job as the tank: you can't cast spells, and you don't have super-cool sneak attack moves like me." As he said this, Mareak jabbed out with an imaginary dagger. "But without you around, I get knocked down twice. Embrace your role."

Yannhorn nodded and said nothing. The party sat in silence for a few moments, digesting the moment of calm and the thoughts they had shared.

"Thanks guys," Yannhorn said. "Again, I really appreciate hearing thesethings from you guys, but I'm not going to change overnight. I guess the best I can do is prove that I'm up to the role by getting us out of here, and I think I can."

Yannhorn stood up and yanked on the chains on his wrists a few times. He pressed his feet into the ground and lunged forward. The chains held strong, but continued to push. 

"I'm going to do this," he said while gritting his teeth. "I'm a tank,"" he continued, "albeit a small one. I can do it. And I mean it this time."

He made a second effort, but the chain continued to hold. Mareak was about to step forward, but Darella held him back.

On Yannhorn's third effort, they heard a slight cracking sound. He looked behind himself at the stone wall, and long cracks developed in the wall. Yannhorn kept pulling, and the stones where his chain was nailed into the wall began to move. Pulling and pulling, he exerted himself entirely, and on his last pull, the entire wall suddenly gave. The stones fell to the ground, breaking Yannhorn's chains. The others rushed up to him for high fives, but the moment was overly quickly when they looked in the gaping hole in the wall to see a marble white room, with Lamaramakama sitting on a throne in the middle of it.

Their joy turned serious as the party stepped over the rubble and into the marble room. Tall Roman-style columns held up the lofty ceiling, but other than those and the throne, the room was empty.

"I see you have made it," said Lamaramakama without any hint of surprise.

"We made it," Mareak said triumphantly. He held out an open palm. "Hand over whatever it is that you took."

Lamaramakama then began to laugh. "But I don't have it!" He held out his hands open as well to show he had nothing to hide.

"That's not how this works!" Darella said in outrage. "You told us you had it: what sort of game is this?"

"I said no such thing." Lamaramakama re-adjusted on the throne and wiggled his tiny toes. "I said that you could have it if you could find it, and I said that I was in my keep. _You_ assumed that finding me was finding your treasure."

Mareak began to reach for his dagger, but Yannhorn put his own hand over Mareak's.

"Wait," Yannhorn said. "I think I have this one."

"How?", Mareak said. He didn't move his hand from his dagger. "We got riddles before, and they were all tricks. There's a really easy way to get this done."

Yannhorn closed his eyes for a moment and nodded. "I know. It is really easy. It's just over there." He pointed out with his other hand, and when everyone looked in that direction, they saw a crystal sphere floating on a pedestal.

Lamaramakama hopped out of his throne and bowed to Yannhorn. "Congratulations, sir. Just as I hoped that this treasure would bring me understanding of the material plane, I hope that your experience here has brought you deeper understanding. The Sphere of Eternal Will is yours for the taking." Lamaramakama then hopped back up into his seat and sat patiently.

"That's it?" Darella said. Lamaramakama nodded, and the party walked over to the pedestal. "You know, I was wishing we would find it all along," she said to Yannhorn. "What did you do differently?"

Yannhorn lifted the sphere with both hands off of the pedestal and into his keeping. "Sorry to disappoint, but it was as simple as willing it be here. I think we all thought we would catch Lamaramakama, and he would give it to us. Maybe if we had just imagined finding it on its own, we would have gotten it much sooner."

The others nodded in agreement and looked deep into the sphere. Within, the sphere had seemingly millions of facets, and the patterns went down infinitely. Simply peering in, all of them were inspired greatly.

Yannhorn interrupted the moment for them. "Okay, guys. We did it. Let's go home. I think there's a portal back right behind us."
