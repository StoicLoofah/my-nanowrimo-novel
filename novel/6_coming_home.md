6. Coming Home
==============

"Thanks for bringing over the chili," said Carl after swallowing a mouthful. "This is delicious."

"No problem," said Wayne. "I told you that I made some mean chili." He scooped himself another bowl of it from the slow cooker while Linsday put a few cookies in her empty bowl. "Thanks for providing us with the desserts. This is an amazing array of cookies." Drew nodded his head in agreement as he chewed down a whole cookie.

"Sure," replied Carl. "They're all leftovers from the after-party anyways, so you can thank any of 7 different moms. I guess this is one of the benefits of hosting."

"Oh yeah, that was just this past weekend," added Drew. "Wow, that seems like forever ago with all of the tests this week. How was your homecoming weekend? Was it good having Marie back in town?"

"Yeah, it was awesome. I feel like it was just like old times. We waved at you at the football game Friday night. I guess you didn't see us." Drew shook his head. "Oh well. Anyways, she ended up having to spend some time with her family, but she left after dinner on Sunday night, so I saw her again before she left."

"I bet homecoming was kind of cheesy for her at this point," said Wayne. "They were really picky about grinding, which I didn't appreciate. That must have really felt like high school right there unlike college parties."

"I'm not really sure how she felt about that, now that you mention it," replied Carl. "She doesn't really talk about college parties much. But as far as I could tell, she was enjoying just seeing everyone again. Linsday, I didn't see you at the dance. I take it you didn't go."

"No, I ended up not going," Linsday said in a bored voice. "I'm glad to hear you had a lot of fun, though."

Carl looked unsure of how to respond, and he stirred his chili idly. "Thanks. I didn't see Rick there, either. I guess he really wanted to go just with you."

"I think a lot of people missed you," added Drew. "Quite a few people asked where you were, as if I would have known."

Linsday didn't respond. She broke a piece off of a sugar cookie and held it between her fingers. The others looked back and forth at each other.

Wayne broke the silence. "Well, how did the math competition go?"

"That went well," Linsday replied eagerly. "I ended up qualifying for state. The team did really well as a whole, and I think our score will stand for going to state as well."

"Oh, congrats!" Drew leaned over to give Linsday a high five. She put the cookie down on her plate before high-fiving back. "Did you crush Memorial?" She nodded, and they high-fived again. Wayne and Carl also got up to high-five Linsday.

"So do you still have to go to the next region event?" asked Wayne as he sat back down.

"Yeah, the whole team has to go to every regional meet as kind of a solidarity sort of thing. Obviously, though, they just go down the list if you qualify twice." The others nodded in agreement.

"Look, sorry guys," Linsday then followed in a much more serious voice. "I don't really mean to bum you guys out about this whole homecoming thing. I really did want to go, but it's kind of hard to justify when math competitions will really light up my eventual college applications." 

"No apologies," Wayne said quickly. "Obviously we know what college apps look like; we just want to make sure you keep some of that balance for your social life, too."

"Totally agree," said Carl. "I really appreciate that you can make it to play with us every month, but I also get mock jealously from some of your other friends who apparently have a tougher time tracking you down. "Just keep them in mind, too."

Linsday smiled back. "Thanks, guys. I don't really have any thoughts here, but I do appreciate getting together to play every month. This is certainly the most unusual group of friends that I have. But enough about me: Drew, I heard you did well at the first debate tournament."

"Sort of," Drew said as a few crumbs fell out of his mouth. He held up a finger to finish chewing before he continued. "The real glory goes to Jimmy and Mario, who took another tournament by storm. But Christie did really well for us, so she and I managed to place as well."

"Sick. So it went pretty smoothly?" asked Wayne.

"I guess," Drew replied. He thought for a second, then giggled. "Well, there was this moment when Iâ€“well, this would take a lot of explaining, and it's not actually that funny anyways. It's fair to say that I went out in a blaze of glory."

"Cool. Well, I think we should get started," said Carl. He flipped the lid of his computer up and typed in his password while talking. "To recap, you guys went into the forest, met the dryads, then got captured by the gnolls."

"Yeah, how did you miss that spot check, Wayne?" asked Drew. "It was clearly a huge net."

"I blame in all on our dungeon master," said Wayne. "Everytime I roll something good, there's nothing to see; whenever I roll low, however, there is amazingly some trap that's there." Wayne tossed a 20-sided die back and forth between his hands.

Carl shook his head, then turned his laptop to show them the screen. "I promise it's all fair. I take lots of notes about the encounters you guys are going to have. Though for what it's worth, there probably would have been another band or gnolls to come by if you had noticed the trap." Wayne just shook his head at a very pleased Carl.

"Okay, should we jump in, then?" Linsday asked. "If we're going to be hanging or carried for awhile, Darella will meditate as much as she can."

"Yeah, that's fine." Carl tapped a few notes into his computer. "You will probably be hanging for maybe 15 minutes, so you clearly won't have enough time to memorize any new spells, but you can take a +1 bonus to concentration the next time you cast a spell." Linsday nodded and took a note on her character sheet of it. "Okay, so another band of gnolls arrive, led by a gnolls roughly of the same size as the one who caught you. He looks up at you and begins to speak in Common..."
