9. Material Difference
====================

Dungeon Investigators Inc. stood outside of the sideways tower. Yannhorn strode up tot he door confidently and ran face first into the door. He stumbled back a few steps and rubbed his nose.

"I wonder why it didn't greet us this time," he said, thinking aloud. He approached the door again and gave it 3 solid knocks. "I really hope that Feenious is home."

"I guess the worst case is that we can visit the Hungry Rabbit and try to find a quest there," said Darella.

"Not the worst idea," said Mareak. "I could use some bonus cash on the side. Unfortunately, I didn't factor in the travel time into our anticipated hourly rate for this trip. I may demand more from Feenious."

"Yes! Feenious is here!", they suddenly heard. They looked around for the source, and Mareak was the first one to find it. He pointed toward the tip of the tower off to their right, where they saw Feenious waving out of the window, also sideways.

"I'll be right down!" Feenious cried at them. He retreated back from the window. Despite the distance, the party could hear gurgling water, metallic crashes, breaking glass, chicken clucking, falling books, and snapping wood coming down the length of the tower. The sound continued as it hit the right angle in the tower and came down the vertical floors. Just as the sound reached the doorway in front of them, the door flew open, and they saw Feenious standing there, perfectly composed.

"Welcome in! Forgive the mess: I'm doing some renovations, hence the broken deadly security system," he said with a big grin on his face. The party muttered thanks and nodded as they walked into the tower. Inside the reception area was the biggest surprise: the room was clean.

"Wow, I love what you have done with the place," said Darella. "These wooden chairs look much more sanitary than the old couches you had."

"Without the dust and books strewn everywhere, I feel like I might be in a respectable library," said Yannhorn. He walked over to the single bookshelf, which held some of presumably the most important volumes. He scanned the titles, felt the cleanliness of the shelves with his index finger, and walked away satisfied.

"Now, please tell me you have found this artifact," Feenious said. He stood in the middle of the room, constantly twisting to look at all of three of them as usually.

"Never change," Darella said as she reached into her pocket. She fished out the Seed and tossed it to Feenious who caught it with both hands as a basket. "This is the Seed of Eternal Spring. It apparently has helped the dryads there to grow strong and plentiful and fluorish altogether."

"Wondeful," he said. "I guess this explains the quote about it being the 'seed of life.'"

Mareak blinked rapidly and focused again on Feenious. "Wait, did you just say that you knew it was a Seed? Why didn't you tell us that? You know, the quest was actually quite hard without that information, and you owe us bonus for that."

Feenious laughed quietly then shrugged. "I thought it was metaphorical. But no matter. Yes, this treasure is certainly worth the finder's fee. And some bonus." He snapped his fingers, and gold pieces appeared in mid-air and fell onto a small cauldron in the middle of the room. The party all sprang forward to grab their share.

"I will keep this safe while you continue your adventure," Feenioius continued. "Darella, did you have a chance to inspect the seed at all?"

"No, I didn't," she said. She closed her coin purse and stood to face Feenious. "The past few days between resting at the Burned Skillet and arriving on your doortep just flew by."

"Well, I will conduct my own experiments upon it. As you might expect, however, I believe the seed brings one into greater touch with natural energy, unlike that horrific Ruby of Eternal Light. I imagine it may amplify your druidic powers, but that remains to be seen."

"Speaking of which," Yannhorn jumped in, "what's our next move? Malafar presumably is powering up right now, and you said we needed _items_, plural, to be able to defeat him. Have you found anymore in the area?"

"Indeed I have," Feenious replied, twisting a few hairs in his beard. "I assure you that this will be your most exotic setting yet."

"I find that hard to believe," said Mareak. "We have fought pirates on the high seas, explored faraway ziggurats, and even escaped a jungle where trees grew upside down. But of course," he added, "if it is that exotic, we should be compensated extra."

"What about another plane?" Feenious said. He drew a wand out of a pocket in the folds of his robe and drew a large circle with the tip in the air. The area inside of the circle appeared to warp and wobble, then swirl, and instead of looking through to the other side, they saw an image into another world.

The party all came close to look at the projection in mid-air. Inside, they saw a brilliant pink and purple, translucent landscape. Instead of grass or rock, the ground had a ribbony, billowing look.

"Mareak, I think this might have pirates beat," said Yannhorn. "Feenious, I thought you said that we were looking for items of the material plane. Why do we have to go somewhere else for it?"

"Well, you like to collect souvenirs of places you have been, yes? Well, an inhabitant of this plane happened to find a treasure of the material plane they did not want to leave behind. And you must take it from him. Look, there he is!" The party turned to look at the projection, and within, they saw a large, bulbous, green creature with fairies flying all about it. It shuffled along on two disproportionately small legs, and its 4 arms waved about in circles. The details on its head were hard to see, but it was only vaguely humanoid.

"He doesn't look too tough," said Yannhorn. "We just need to get in there, bully him around, and get out."

"Looks can be deceiving," Feenious replied, sounding far wiser than usual. "This plane does not obey the same laws as our own, and you might find it quite a challenge. Even so, we can go as soon as you're ready." Feenious poked his wand into the middle of the projection, and the image collapsed in upon the point. The party looked at each other for confirmation, then all began nodding in agreement. "Alright, this way. And don't touch anything on the way.

Feenious stepped past the party and towards a nearby wall. As he approached, the stones of the wall slid to form a staircase, which he began ascending.

"You know, I never thought about how he gets down here," Darella said. "He usually just appears and starts talking." She followed close behind. The staircase continued to form itself in a spiral around the walls of the tower as Feenious ascended. When they neared the top, they saw a doorway in the side of the tower, which Feenious pushed open.

"Mind the gap," he said as he stepped through.

"I don't see any gap," said Darella. As she stepped in, she felt the floor fall out from beneath her. The world rushed by her as her body fell forward. She reached out with her hands to break her fall.

And found herself standing upright with her arms extended, like Frankenstein, in the middle of an alchemy lab. Still disoriented, she stumbled forward a few steps and stopped herself just short of a table of beakers and test tubes.

"Don't touch!" Feenious said. Darella quickly brought her arms back close to her body. Yannhorn and Mareak similarly stumbled out of the doorway and reoriented themselves to the room. Feenious waved them onward, and they followed him up a stairwell. They ascended several more floors filled with a random assortment of magical, scientific, and baffling sights. Soon, Feenious stepped into a room where only a single object sat in the middle covered with a white sheet.

When all three of the party entered the room, Feenious walked over to the sheet and in one dramatic motion, he pulled the sheet off to reveal a wooden chair.

"Uh, did we come all this way to help you setup for a dinner party?" asked Yannhorn.

"No, no, sit! It's a magical, planeshifting chair!" He tossed the sheet to the side and held both hands out towards the chair.

"Feenious, there's one chair," Mareak said. "And there are three of us."

Feenious's excited smile turned to skeptical and thoughful face. "Hmm, I hadn't considered that when designing it. Well, it takes a lot of energy to run it multiple times, so you'll all need to sit together. In each other's laps." The party stared at Feenious and quickly determined that he was not joking.

"Well, Darella, you're the biggest of us, so you first." Darella rolled her eyes and sat in the chair. Next, Mareak fitted his elven frame in Darella's lap, and then the halfling Yannhorn hopped up last.

"Now, don't move," said Feenious. He began to wave his hands around in the air and chanted a magical spell.

"Wait, how do we get back?" cried Mareak. Feenious looked at him to indicate that he had heard the question, but he continued to chanting. The three felt their bodies turn light, and when they looked down at their bodies, they saw themselves slightly transparent. Tingling filled their bodies, and their vision started to fog up, half filled with the tower room and half purple-pink.

The chanting stopped, and they heard Feenious say, "When you find the item, you should have a strong connection to the material plane, and you will figure it out. Enjoy!" And with that, the room flashed out, and they were in a another plane.

---

"What do we have here?" said the green creature. It stood over the pile of 3 adventurers lying on the ground. They lay for a second before reorienting to the plane and the immediately scrambled off of each other and to their feet.

"We're representatives of the Guild Dedicated to the Integrity of the Material Plane," Mareak said, "and I am Grant Master Mareak. These are my colleagues, Yannhorn and Darella."

"Pleased to meet you," it said in a reedy voice from a poorly defined mouth. It extended a hand to each of the them, which they all accepted and shook hands. The hands felt gelatinous and squished easily under their grips. "My name is Lamaramakama. What brings you to my plane?" 

"Well, as you might have guessed, we are interested in preserving the material plane," explain Mareak. As he spoke, the others nodded in agreement. "We have been made aware of an item in your possession that, when taken from the material plane, may lead to a significant disruption in the fabric of the plane."

"There's about a 63% chance of complete collapse within the next year!" added Darella.

"Indeed," Mareak said with the greatest seriousness. "Now, we would be willing to overlook this matter if you could simply return it to us, and we will be on our way."

Lamaramakama did not move for several seconds before responding. "I'm afraid I will not comply."

"And why is that?"

"Well, I believe you are not part of this Guild because your nose has steadily been growing since you began talking." Mareak crossed his eyes to look down, and instead of his usual, sharp, small nose, he saw it extend for several inches from his face.

"I can explain," Mareak said. His nose grew again.

Yannhorn then jumped in. "Look, buddy, just hand over whatever you took from the material plane, and no one gets hurt." He reached to pull out his sword, but when he closed his hand upon the grip, he found nothing. He looked down at his sheath and saw that his sword was gone.

"Threats? In my plane? Now that is a poor thing for a visitor to do. You have proven nothing to me yet" Lamaramakama then began to walk away. The fairies around him formed a wall and transformed into hideous, giant mosquitos. "Enjoy your stay," Lamaramakama called out, and he disappeared into the landscape.

"Great job, both of you," Darella said. She reached for her pouch of reagents, but also found that way gone. "I think we may have lost some of our material possessions when we transported over," she said.

"I guess we'll do it the old-fashioned way," Mareak said. He raised his fist into boxing positions. "This is just like my days on the streets."

One of the mosquitos dived at Mareak with its proboscis. Mareak weaved to the side to avoid it and punched with his close hand into the oncoming face of the mosquito. His hand passed through its body like water, and the mosquito turned back into a fairy and lay immobile on the ground.

Darella dropped back several steps and looked around. She knelt and touched the ground, which felt oddly bumpy. She grabbed a handful of it, and when she looked at her hand, she saw a pile of dirt. Smiling, she waved her other hand over it and watched as the dirt solidified and slid to coat her body. With her improvised armor, she watched as a giant mosquito came in, and it's proboscis hit her in the chest and crumpled. With both hands overheard, she slammed down upon the mosquito.

Seeing two of their friends go down, the rest of the mosquitos turned back into fairies and fluttered off.

"Wait, I have to deal with one of you, too!", called out Yannhorn. He ran several steps forward after them, then gave up. "Well, there goes my moment of glory."

As he came back to the others, one of the fairies began to slowly come to.

"Woah, where am I?", the fairy asked in a small but sweet, feminine voice.

"You're in good company, sister," Mareak said. "We can be friends if you don't attack again, okay?" He picked the fairy up off of the ground.

"Okay," she responded. "So what do friends do together?"

"Well, they don't turn into blood-sucking insects and attack," said Yannhorn.

"But they do help to protect each other and guide them through tough times," added Darella. "It's really important that we find whatever it is that Lamaramakama took from our home. Do you happen to know what that might be?"

"No, I have no idea," the fairy replied. "But I can guide to you his castle if you want. Then you can ask him yourself." With that, the fairy lifted herself out of Mareak's hands and began to fly off.

"Do we follow her?" asked Darella.

"I guess so," replied Mareak.

"It's a trap," said Yannhorn.

"Oh, it's definitely a trap," said Mareak.

"Sounds like we're in agreement," said Darella, and they all started off together after the fairy.

---

"So you heard our names earlier," said Mareak. They walked along with the fairy, who danced and flew up and down through the air. "What's your name?"

"My name," she said, slightly cross. "Yes my name... you know, I don't think I have a name, or at least can't remember it."

"Well, whether it's your name or now, what should we call you?" asked an impatient Yannhorn. It had been almost an hour of walking, and in that time, they had seen nothing: no trees, no buildings, no landmarks, no other beings. The pitch black sky also revealed nothing.

"If you need a name, you can call me Hannah," the fairy replied.

"That's creative," said Mareak, somewhat disappointed. "So Hannah, I must admit, we have been following you for a long time, and though we trust you, I kind of feel like your ambling around hasn't really led us to anything."

"What were you expecting?" she asked. She stopped and turned to look at the party.

"I'm surprised that there doesn't appear to be any vegetation or any sort," said Darella. "I would expect maybe some grass or a tree. What do you eat, anyways?"

"You mean like that fruit tree?" The fairy pointed behind the party, and when they looked, they saw a single, small, blue-green tree standing there.

"How did we miss that?" Yannhorn asked. They all started walking towards the tree, and as they got closer, the tree appeared bigger and bigger. When they arrived at the foot of the tree, it was 20 stories tall. Amidst the blue-green leaves were a wide variety of fruits: apples, pears, orange, and bananas.

"For such an exotic tree, I was kind of expecting something stranger to be growing here," said Yannhorn. He picked an apple off of the tree, rubbed it on his sleeve, then took a bite. "Tastes like an apple," he said.

The others also grabbed fruits off of the tree and began nibbling. Hannah tried to take a pear, but she couldn't quite get her arms around it to pull it off the branch. Mareak reached over to give it a yank, and it fell to the ground. Hannah gleefully dove down onto the pear and began to eat. The rest of the party relaxed back against the tree and ate their fruit.

"This plane maybe isn't so bad," said Mareak while eating his third orange. "I feel like I have to apologize to you, Hannah. I thought you were leading us into a trap, but this is quite pleasant."

When Mareak said the word "trap", Hannah's eyes went wide, and she flew in close to Mareak. Mareak looked around alarmingly, then found the source of concern.

They heard a series of hoots and screams from the tree, and a bunch of monkeys rappelled down. Before any of the party could react, the monkeys swarmed each of them, pinning them down and slapping them.

Yannhorn tried to shove them away, but his limbs weren't long enough to get enough leverage to push any of the monkeys away. He tried to roll back and forth, but the monkeys held him firm.

"Run," yelled Mareak to Hannah. Hannah tried to fly away, but a monkey grabbed her out of the sky. The monkeys grabbed at Mareak, but he managed to get the tree trunk behind him. He brought his knees in close, and kicked out violently, throwing off a few of the monkeys. He quickly got to his feet and spun around to flnig the rest off of him.

Darella was surprised the most and took several bites from the monkeys before realizing they were under attack. When she realized the nature of her attackers, she uttered a quick spell.

"Stop!", she yelled, and the monkeys around her all froze. "Back!" The monkeys, completely under her spell, all stepped backwards several steps. Darella stood up and ran over to help the others.

Mareak quickly scanned the scene and saw a monkey clutching something in its hands. He ran over to the monkey and gave it a kick in the back, upon which it let loose Hannah and fell face-first. Hannah flew up and out of reach of any monkeys. Mareak then turned back to see Yannhorn continuing to struggle. With the help of both Mareak and Darella, Yannhorn managed to push away all of the monkeys.

"What was that," Yannhorn said rhetorically while breathing heavily. He looked up to deal with the next batch of monkeys, they had all disappeared. He took several more breaths and regarded his companions again. "Well, some help I was."

"Don't worry about it," said Mareak. "We're still a team. Right, Hannah?"

"Right!", she replied. "Thanks for the help there, sort of."

Mareak wrinkled his brow at this comment. "You're welcome? What do you mean 'sort of'?"

"Well, it's kind of your fault," she said sassily. Yannhorn and Darella looked puzzled as well.

"How did I cause monkeys to come out of the tree?"

"Because you thought it first," she said. She looked expectingly at them as though it was all obvious, but they just stared back at her dumbfounded. "Do you not know how this world works?" The others shook their heads. 

"Well," she began, "it's quite simple. In this plane, the world is largely determined by your thoughts." She rattled off this sentence as though she were reading a book. "If you believe something with enough conviction, it will probably become true. There are, of course, some innate properties to the plane, and things may not quite work when different thoughts conflict, but that's basically the idea."

"So I made the tree appear? And the ground turned to dirt when I needed it?" asked Darella. Hannah smiled and nodded happily.

"And I made those monkeys appear?" asked Mareak. Hannah nodded at him, too. "And we walked for that entire time without seeing anything, maybe because we didn't have any expectation of what we were going to see?" Hannah just smiled at this one. Mareak looked in wonder at the others, then laughed. Without looking, he reached up into the tree with one hand and pulled out a watermelon. Hannah and Darella looked at the massive fruit in his hand and laughed as well.

"Well, wait a minute!" said Yannhorn, shaking his hand and waving his hands in the air. "That doesn't make any sense. Let's look at my track record. I reached for my sword earlier, thinking it would be there, and it was gone. I thought that the fruits would be weird, but they weren't. And I definitely believe that I can beat a couple monkeys. What about me?"

Hannah looked at him curiously, then quietly asked, "Did you really believe those things?"

Yannhorn gave her a look of complete disbelief. "Yeah, sure, why not? Yannhorn believes in Yannhorn." He looked at Mareak and Darella for help, but neither of them had anything to say. "Aww, screw it. Look, I know me, and I don't need some strange plane to validate my own beliefs."

"I'm not really sure what to say," said Mareak. "Maybe it doesn't quite work for you, but we're still in good shape here. Besides, I think we'll find Lamaramakama's castle soon enough."

"Me, too," added Darella, and she started walking without waiting for Hannah to lead them. Not 10 minutes later, they saw a castle arise in the distance. Smiling, they rushed forward towards their destination.

The castle had roughly the layout they expected: a moat filled with water surrounded it, and ramparts ran along the 6 story high walls. There was a tower at each of the 4 corners, and they could see a keep inside the walls. The gate had a large drawbridge, and several figures stood as guards at the entrance. Also somewhat expected: it was also a shimmering, everchanging pink and purple color.

"So that's where Lamaramakama lives, right?" asked Darella.

"I think so," said Hannah. "It appears to be better guarded and scarier than it usually is, though."

"My bad," said Mareak sheepishly.

"So what, we siege and storm the castle?" asked Yannhorn. The others looked at him worried. "Hey, I can't make things worse for us, as Hannah has so aptly pointed out. I'm just trying to help."

"That's okay," said Darella. "Look, I think we need some time to figure out how this plane works, how we can plan, and how our plans will affect how this plane works. Let's stop for now and we can get whatever it we're looking for soon."
