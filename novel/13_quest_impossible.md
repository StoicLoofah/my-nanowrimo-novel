13. Quest Impossible
=====================

"Welcome back, Dungeon Investigators Inc.," a voice said as the door opened. Unlike the wispy voice from last time, this voice had a distinctly feminine quality to it that was actually welcoming.

They walked into the same circular room, and they saw Feenious running down the emerging stairwell. "I'm coming," he cried out, and in his haste, he skipped a step and tried to land on a step that had not fully formed. He fell forward into the gap and dropped 2 floors facedown into a couch.

"I'm here," he said, muffled by the couch cushion. Feenious lifted himself up, put his hat back on, and smiled to the concerned adventurers in front of him. "Sorry, I wasn't expecting you at the front door. Why didn't you come back via the chair portal?"

"We were supposed to use the chair again?", Mareak asked. "How were we supposed to that?" As he spoke, Yannhorn and Darella sat down in their usual spots while Mareak continued to stand to avoid sitting right next to Feenious.

Feenious laughed. "Quite obvious, really. You just needed to find the original spot you came into the plane from and rearrange yourselves in the same position." Mareak gave him a look of confusion and skepticism but said nothing. Feenious continued without acknowledging him. "So did you find it?"

"Yes," Yannhorn said. "That's what I'm holding here, in my hands." Feenious looked expectantly at him and them gestured for Yannhorn to bring it to him. Yannhorn sighed, got up, walked to Feenious, and gently handed it to him.

"Impressive," Feenious said, "very impressive." He held it in both hands in his lap and looked deeply into it. "Does it have a name?"

"Ball of Eternal Will?", Mareak guessed.

"_Sphere_ of Eternal Will," Darella corrected.

"Of course," Feenious said. He transferred it to his left hand and snapped his right. Coins showered down in the middle of the room, where Mareak was still standing. The party pounced while Feenious continued. "It will take more analysis, but I imagine that this reinforces your morale or energy."

"I think that's pretty consistent with what we saw in the other plane," replied Darella over her shoulder as she grabbed more coins off of the ground. "So what's up next? Do we have to find the 'Staff of Eternal Force'?"

"Or maybe the 'Helm of Eternal Power'?", guessed Yannhorn.

"No, it's got to be the 'Tome of Eternal Knowledge'," said Mareak.

Feenious shook his head. "No, it's none of those. You have to get the Flame Diamond from a warlord in a far east land. Where did you come up with those guesses? Are there other treasures you have heard of to acquire?"

"No," Yannhorn replied. "We were just guessing. Have any other information on it?"

"Well, this warlord is named Kang, and he is tremendously wealthy. I would guess that he treasures the Fire Diamond for its appearance alone and is unaware of its more important properties in contributing to the survival of our realm.

"I have already prepared transport for you, so whenever you're ready, you're a boat ride away from the city of Lanko."

---

"Wow, that was a fast and uneventful trip," Mareak said as he disembarked from the boat. "It's like one moment we were in the tower, and the next moment, we're standing in the docks of Lanko."

"Speak for yourself," Yannhorn said with some gusto. "I used the trip to hone some of my skills, and I feel significantly more powerful and experienced now than at the end of the last adventure."

"Alright guys, let's get a move on it," Darella said. "Do either of you know what language they speak here?" Yannhorn and Mareak both shook their heads. "Great. I guess it would be a stretch then, that either of you should know how to speak whatever the local language is."

At that moment, a dockworker carrying a crate bumped into Darella. "Sorry," he said in Common, and shuffled onward.

"Not a stretch," Yannhorn said. The next dockworker shuffled past, and Yannhorn tapped him on the shoulder. "Friend, where can we find the nearest inn or tavern?"

"Clapping Eel," the dockworker said. "Straight ahead. You can't miss it." Yannhorn nodded, and the party walked into town.

Lanko was unlike any city in Shermland. The buildings were made of brick, but the roofs were curved and brightly colored. The people all had black hair, and though most dressed plainly, the guards did not have the same metal armor they had expected. Most wore ornately decorated leather armor. And although the people spoke the same language as them, their writing was shorter and a more complex set of characters formed out of various strokes.

"I don't know if we're going to find this Snapping Eel place," Mareak said after they walked several blocks. "I can't read any of the signs." Mareak stopped a bricklayer walking past him and asked, "Do you know where I can find the Snapping Eel?"

"He means 'Clapping Eel'," Darella said.

"Clapping Eel?" The bricklayer rubbed his stubbly chin. "Never heard of it." He shrugged and continued walking.

"Great start, team," Yannhorn said. "Just believe every bricklayer you see. Why don't we just duck in here?" He looked into the building they stood next to. "It's what, a noodle shop? Hopefully they take the same gold pieces that we have."

The party entered the noodle shop. Inside, there were several long tables with benches, and in the back, they saw a kitchen filled with steam. Cooks were stretching and pulling noodles, and servers scurried back and forth with hot bowls of noodles. No one came to greet the party, so they sat down at a table next to several laughing peasant women. A server quickly sat down a pot of tea and a stack of cups and ran off again.

"So, what's the plan?", Darella asked.

"No plan. I'm just hoping for information," replied Yannhorn.

"Shh," Mareak said. "Talk quietly. I'm scanning the room for relevant details."

"Who put you in charge?", Yannhorn asked.

Mareak replied while looking around the room, "We need to execute a heist in a new and unfamiliar place. I think you should let the rogue lead."

"Good point."

Yannhorn and Darella continued to make small talk. Mareak picked up on the local gossip: who the mayor's daughter was marrying, news about crop season, works from city artisans. However, there was nothing about Kang.

"Excuse me," Mareak said politely to the women next to him. They all quieted down to listen. "We're new in town and wanted to know more about things around here."

The women looked amongst themselves to determine who would respond. One spoke up. "Lanko is very welcoming to outsiders. What can we tell you?"

Their server came back and began settting out steaming bowls in front of the party. While they were being served, Mareak continued. "Well first, we have heard that there's an important guy in town. What do you know about Kang?"

When Mareak said the word Kang, the entire restaurant instantly went silent. The women suddenly looked frightened. Their server flinched at the moment he was setting down Mareak's bowl, and the bowl spilled out over Mareak's right hand.

"Oooohhh, hot," he said. He reached it cool off his hand with his tea, but when he dumped that over his hand, it stung even more. 

"You must not invoke his name!", said one of the other women at their table. "As outsiders, you must be more careful! Only bad karma will follow you if you continue to test him, like the scalding water on your hand."

"Well, technically, it was your reaction to his mention that caused that," Darella pointed out.

"I see no difference," said the original woman speaking to them. She stood and spoke to the whole shop. "They're new here. Do not worry: it will not happen again. The squad will not be summoned." She sat down again and pointed at Mareak. "Do _not_ say that name again, or else you may be thrown into prison. Now what did you want?"

Mareak was distracted by his hand, but Yannhorn jumped in. "Sorry again for my friend's faux pas. We really just want to know where he lives."

The women looked between themselves again before the leader answer again. "Why do you ask?"

"We have a gig there tonight?" No one reacted. "Just kidding. We're trying to findâ€“"

"Shush," Darella interrupted. "Ladies, we're not at liberty to say, but we just need to know where to go to find him."

"What do they care?", Yannhorn replied. "Her reaction earlier indicated that she's no friend of this warlord guy, and given the fear and title, I think he might have more than a few enemies around here." Darella thought for a moment, then nodded her consent. "Good. See, this warlord has a jewel that we really need to save the world, and we would like to get it back from him."

"I see," the woman replied. "Well, perhaps we might be on the same side. The warlord lives in the walled compound near the barracks, but it is difficult to enter." She leaned in and spoke in a low voice. "Meet us tonight just at sunset in the alley behind the herbal medicine store on Dragon Way. We can discuss more there." She stood up, and the rest of her group stood up in unison and followed her as they left the shop together.

"Well, I got a date but no number," Yannhorn said to Darella, who rolled her eyes. "Mareak, how's your hand doing?"

"Not good," he replied, shaking it out and gritting his teeth. "Darella, do you have anything to help here?"

"Oh yes, of course." She reached into her pouch and pulled out a dried blossom. "Put this in your tea and drink it. Unfortunately, my typical healing only deals with cuts, bruises, and maybe some charring, but not so many liquid burns. Your hand will be fine, but it might be numb for awhile."

"Fine," Mareak replied. He took the blossom, tossed it in his cup, then filled it with liquid again. "Let's finish eating, and then we can go scout out this complex."

---

"Just keep walking, and stop looking at it," Mareak said. Yannhorn snapped his head forward. "Let me do the looking. Count the trees or something."

Dungeon Investigators Inc. strolled leisurely past the gate to Kang's compound amidst the afternoon crowd. The compound itself was enormous: 3 floors tall and several rooms wide and deep. Around it was a 10 foot wall that kept most of the inside out of sight. The gate itself was large enough for a cart to ride through, but the metal doors appeared hefty. Two guards stood outside with swords in their scabbards.

"What do you see?", Darella asked. She kept her eyes fixed on the shops on her right while Mareak occasionally looked towards the compound to their left.

"Not a lot," he replied. "The guard patrol is basically continuous, so I doubt I will find an opportunity to scale the wall unseen. I haven't noticed any defects in the wall either, which is no surprise. Let's take another pass."

Mareak stopped and walked over to a food cart. "Darella, you were just talking about how hungry you were," he began. "It's my treat." He looked casually back at the gate.

"I was?", she replied in surprise. Yannhorn coughed. "Oh yes, I was."

"Of course, my dear," said the cheerful man behind the cart. "You look absolutely famished. What would you like? A bowl of porridge? How about a freshly steamed bun?"

Darella continued to discuss her options with the vendor while Mareak continued to watch the gate. As he watched, he noticed a small group of people cutting across the street towards the gate. So far, they had seen few non-humans in the city, so this group of elves surprised him.

"It's Yannhorn's treat," he quickly said to Darella and dashed off towards the gate. He came up close behind the group but didn't address any one of them. As they neared the gate, he kneeled down and tried to blend into the traffic.

Although he couldn't make out what they were saying, one of the elves addressed the guard and spoke for a few seconds. The guard nodded, and he knocked on the door. The door then opened just enough for the elves to walk in in single file, then it closed.

Mareak dashed up to the gate and looked at the guard. "Whew, sorry about that," he said between deep breaths. "I just looked into a bakery a block back, and the rest of my fellow elves had left me behind! Mind popping the door open? I don't want to fall too far back."

The guard narrowed his eyes behind the shadow of his helmet. "Oh really? I only had 5 elves on the guest list for tonight, and 5 just walked through."

"Hah." Mareak waved his hand dismissively. "My brother is so absent-minded. He's always leaving me off of the count. Look, can we just forget it?"

The guard rolled his eyes, grunted, then knocked on the door. 

"Thanks," Mareak said as the door began to open. "My brother hates it when I fall behind." Before he could step through, the guard knocked on the door again, and the door slammed in his face.

"They were all female elves," the guard said sternly.

"Uh, you know, elves tend to look very feminine to all non-elves," Mareak said with a cheesy grin on his face. Both guards began to reach towards their scabbards. "I'll just leave now."

Mareak slowly backed away from the gate with his hands in the air.

"Good job," Yannhorn said when Mareak reached him. "We were watching the whole thing."

"Yeah, what happened?", Darella said.

"Nothing interesting," Mareak replied. "I don't think we're getting in through the front door. We'll have to sneak in through the loading door at the back. At least I found out that there's a party tonight, so there should be plenty of food and drink going in."

"Fine," Yannhorn said. He took a bite of a bun. "I'm going to go find a place to sit down and rest for the afternoon. Scout more if you want, and we can plan to meet those ladies tonight."

---

"So, you think this is another trap?", Darella asked as they stood outside the herbal medicine store on Dragon Way.

"Probably, but it seems like the right thing to do," Yannhorn said. "You don't just run into random strangers who invite you to meet later without a good reason. Let's go, but keep your weapons ready."

The three walked around the side of the store. The alley was clear and led to an opening behind the shop. Walking single file through the alley, they headed towards the setting sun in fron of them.

"Don't panic," Mareak said quietly, "but there are multiple people on the roof."

"Should we turn back?", asked Yannhorn.

"Nope," Mareak replied. "Darella, be ready to shield us as necessary, and Yannhorn, have your sword ready."

They exited the other side of the alley and into the wider alley running behind the shops. They arranged themselves back-to-back and looked around the area. All was silent.

"Get that shield up _now_!", Mareak directed. Darella reached into her pouch and threw a cloud of dust into the air. A throwing knife came flying towards them, but before they could react, it hit the cloud and fell harmlessly to to ground in a shower of sparkles.

Yannhorn brought his shield up. Darella grabbed her club. Mareak reached to pull out two daggers, but fumbled with the one out of his numb, right hand.

"Here's the trap!", Yannhorn cried, and several figures appeared on the rooftops and surrounding alleys dressed in dark robes and cloth over their faces. They launched themselves at the party without weapons and struck out with their fists.

Darella reacted quickly and kept her club between her and her assailant. The fists came rapidly, but she shifted back and forth to swat away blows with as little effort as possible.

Yannhorn held his shield up and had little difficulty deflecting blows. With a series of jabs, he kept the attackers at bay though did little in response.

Seeing his opponents without weapons, Mareak dropped his other dagger and began to exchange blows with his opponent. Calling on his past boxing in the streets, he kept his fists close and absorbed the blows with as little force as possible. Although he couldn't swing with his numb hand, it did serve as an effective block.

"Stop!", they heard someone cry from the rooftop soon after the melee had begun. The attackers immediately backed off as the rooftop figure gracefully leapt down. "We have seen enough." 

"Seen enough?", asked Mareak. He dropped his fists. "Was this a test?"

"Indeed," the figure said, then took off their mask. "Good to see you again, too."

"You!", Yannhorn said, pointing his sword. "You're the lady from the the noodle shop. And the rest of you," he said, slowly bringing his sword towards the other figures, "you were eating noodles, too?"

"Yes, they're all with me. You can call me Wen. Please, let's sit in the store. We should discuss plans."

"I think we should move tonight: there's a party," Mareak said as they followed Wen back through the alley.

"I know," she replied. "We already have our way in. Are you prepared?" She pushed open the door to the shop. Although the light was dim, they could see the rows of herbs and other reagants in large glass jars lining the wall behind the counter. Wen sat down at a large, round table with a kettle of tea already steaming.

"No," Mareak said as he pulled a chair out to sit down. "Though you presume a lot about our methods, and we know nothing about your motivations here." Yannhorn and Darella took the seats next to Mareak. 4 other women filtered into the store, sat, and took their masks off.

"Our motivations are simple." Wen stood again and began pouring out tea for everyone. "We wish to see the warlord removed from power. He has disrupted the regular flow of business to and from Lanko, and we wish to see him gone." 

"By force?", Yannhorn asked. He patted his sword.

"If necessary, though you may have noticed that our methods are more subtle than that. You seek the Flame Diamond: if you can get so close to the warlord as to take it from him, then it should be no problem to also take the Lion's Staff, which has granted him so much power." Wen looked patiently at the party.

"Why do you need us?", Mareak asked. "Apparently you have already have your entrance to the compound. We could do all of this without you."

"Perahsp," Wen replied as she swirled her cup of tea. "Opportunities to enter the compound, however, are quite rare, and had you come a day later, it may be months before you had another opportunity like the party tonight. And since you have already revealed that you have no entry plan, and we can provide that, we should be aligned."

Mareak glanced at Yannhorn and Darella, neither of whom had anything to add. "Fine," he agreed. "We can help, but we need to plan. First, how are you getting in?"

"My ladies will be part of the serving staff at the event tonight," she said. The other women at the table sighed.

"Okay, so I have no experience as wait staff. How are the three of us getting in?"

---

"This literally stinks," said Yannhorn out a barrel. Dungeon Investigators Inc. were packed in the back of a cart bouncing along the Lanko road, each in their own barrel. For the moment, the tops were popped up as they spoke. As they went over a bump, a fish flopped out of Yannhorn's barrel. "There are 5 barrels, and I have to get a fish one?"

"Deal with it," Darella said. "Mareak, can you run over the plan again?"

"Of course," Mareak said. "As the planner myself, I am proud to share with you my brilliance." The cart driver turned and shushed the party, who all lowered slightly into their barrels. Mareak continued in a softer voice. "These barrles will likely end up in the kitchen storage room. We'll get past the gate easily, and from the storage room, I have the path memorized to the upper level using all servant's routes. Then, it's just a matter of being careful, dispatching guards, working towards the prize, and then busting out in a blaze of glory."

"That's awfully simple," Yannhorn said. "Simple should be easy, but I feel that we're headed into another trap."

"Nonsense," Mareak replied. "If you trust those ninja ladies, we should be fine."

"Heads down!", the driver said as they approached the back of the compound. The party all ducked back down into their barrels, and in the case of Yannhorn, held their breath.

The horse clopped along for a short while until the cart came to a stop.

"What are you bringing tonight?", they heard a muffled voice say.

"Fish and rice," the cart driver replied. "The fish is very fresh, and I would like to get it to the cooks as soon as possible."

"Now, now, don't be hasty," the first voice replied. They heard footsteps approach the back of the cart. "We'll have to check your cargo. The warlord wants top priority for this event." There was silence, then they heard a lid come off of a barrel with a crack.

"Hey!", the driver cried. "Inspect if you want, but don't break my barrels!" They heard the lid go back down again. Another lid opened, then closed.

"Satisfifed?", the driver called out.

"Not yet," the first voice said, now much closer to the party. "There are 5 barrels, and I still have 3 to go."

Yannhorn heard the steps come close to him, and then he heard shuffling above him.

"Wow, what a night for the Lanko basketball team tonight, huh?", came the cart driver's voice.

"Yeah, I heard it was close. What happened?" Without digging, the guard replaced the lid on Yannhorn's barrel.

The voice became distant again as they spoke with the cart driver about basketball. After a few moments of small talk, the cart began to move again.
