11. Conflict of Beliefs
=======================

"I think our best approach is to be open-minded," said Darella. "We really just need to get in and hopefully not get hurt, so I think we should go with a diplomatic solution. We can go up to the guards, ask forgiveness, and try to get in to see Ramalamakama."

Yannhorn corrected Darella, "First, his name is Lamaramakama. And second, I think it's ridiculous to hope for a diplomatic solution. Count me out of all of this." Yannhorn abruptly got up and wandered away.

"That's okay; let him go," Mareak said. "We can do this ourselves, and we'll just cut his part of the payment when we get back." Darella nodded in agreement. "So we'll just imagine that the whole place is really poorly organized, and Lamaramakama will walk out to meet us."

"Not quite," said Hannah. "Remember, if multiple beliefs conflict, then yours may not come to fruition."

"Thanks for the reminder," Mareak replied. He stared down at the pink-purple castle and squinted to make out details. " We could plan out something extensive, but I think circumstances will be very different from what we try, and that will all change as we walk through. Let's just go for it and hope that we're stronger than Lamaramakama expects."

Mareak and Darella walked towards the castle with Hannah flying along behind them. They moved silently and all tried to focus their thoughts on positive outcomes. At the drawbridge, they saw 2 figures standing ready in full plate mail armor. Each had a pike upright in their right hand and a shield in their left. As the party approached, neither guard moved.

"Heya guys," Mareak said. They didn't respond, and he kept walking forward. "Look, we're hear to see Lamaramakama, so it would be great if you could just–"

Before Mareak could cross the threshold between the guards and the drawbridge, the guards moved their pikes into a cross, barring his entrance. Mareak stopped just short then backed up.

"Okay, be cool," he said. "What's it going to take to get us inside?"

"To pass, you must answer our riddle," said one of the guards. The voice echoed from within the suit of armor. "What creature has 4 feet in the morning, 2 feet in the afternoon, and 3 feet in the evening?"

Darella rolled her eyes. "Well, this is obvious. It might literally be the oldest riddle ever. The answer is 'man'."

"Incorrect," the guard replied. "The answer is the multi-legged chameleon of the astral plane. You may not pass."

"Wow, you just got stung," said Mareak. Darella stood aghast and blinked several times in disbelief. "What are we going to do now?"

Darella began pacing. Mareak tried several times to sneak past the guards, but they turned him back each time, though they did not obviously become any more perturbed than the previous time.

Abruptly, Darella stopped and walked up to one of the guards. "Hello! Anyone in there?", she yelled in its face. The guard didn't move. She moved slowly towards the guard, who didn't flinch. Gently, she reached up to its visor and flipped it open. Inside, there was nothing.

"That is spooky," Mareak said.

"I thought as much," Darella replied. "These guards aren't other beings. They're just constructs of imaginations: no more real or fake than the rest of this castle. Clearly, it is not our own imagination that created this riddle as a pass, or else we would have gotten it right." She began to pace again in thought. "And I guess their current form indicates that someone, probably Lamaramakama, is combating our own will."

"So we can't just will them away," said Mareak. Darella shook her head and him, then continued to pace. "What can we do?"

"Clearly, we cannot break past the guards with an opposing perspective," she replied. "But... but there are limits. Presumably, there are limits on the detail to which imagination becomes real, so if we can just twist the details slightly, then maybe we can get another shot."

"If I'm following you," Mareak began, "then we need to come up with something similar to a riddle to keep it close to Lamaramakama's imagination, but just different enough that we can pass." Darella nodded again, and Hannah began to quiver with excitment. "So, what, like a joke contest?"

"What's black and white and red all over?" one of the guards said. Mareak and Darella looked at each other in triumph and high-fived.

"A newspaper!" Darella yelled and laughed. "What's red, fluffy, covered in chocolate, and orbits the sun?"

The guards were silent for a moment, then one spoke. "A Mars baaa." The guards rattled with amusement. "How many clerics does it take to screw in a light bulb?"

"One," said Mareak, "to cast 'Cure Light'. How many blonds does it take to screw in a lightbulb?"

"Three," replied a guard. Then in unison, they delivered the punchline, "one to hold the bulb and two to turn the ladder." The guards were silent for a few seconds, then continued the context. "Why do golfers carry extra socks?"

Darella and Mareak were silent and deep in thought.

"I don't think I know this one," Mareak whispered to Darella. She shook her head back at him, and they stood and smiled at guards while they continued to think.

"I got this one," Hannah then jumped in. "Because they always get a hole in one!" Everyone burst out in laughter. After recovering, Hannah turned back to the party. "Got another joke?" Everyone became silent again.

"I have a winner here," said Darella, taking a deep breath. "Why was six afraid of seven?"

"Because 'seven eight nine'!", one of the guards said, and they began then rattle again.

"Hah! You're wrong!", Darella exclaimed. The guards quieted down and awaited an explanation.

"Because," Darella began, "seven was a known 'six offender'."

The guards were silent again, and Mareak gritted his teeth. Then, the guards began to rattle again.

"You win!" one cried. "You may pass," said the other. Everyone laughed, and the guards raised their pikes to unbar the way. With the path clear, the party walked onward, over the drawbridge, and into the castle.

---

The castle was quiet when the party walked in. The courtyard was empty, but directly ahead was the keep. Although it didn't appear to be particularly wide, the keep rose for many floors. As their eyes wandered upwards, they saw a window near the top, where a green figure poked its head out.

"Welcome!" Lamaramakama cried. He waved three of his four hands out of the window. "I see you have made it into my home. And you have also brought my fairy home to me. Welcome back, my dear!"

Hannah cooed, then flew up towards Lamaramakama and away from the party. She flew in through the window and disappeared.

"Yeah, we're glad to see you, too," said Mareak. "Look, I'm sorry I lied about our role here earlier, but we're pretty desparate. We're not joking about the part where we care a lot about our plane staying intact and needing whatever you took to make things better."

"Now, now," Lamaramakama said, shaking the mass of his body roughly around his head. "I know you're still not being entirely honest with me: I can feel it in my plane. That may be Darella's true goal, but Mareak, I know you're in this for the wealth and personal gain. If you could imagine success without the material plane, you might choose that instead."

"That–," Mareak cut himself off. "Okay, that's fair. But it's still a mostly true statement."

"As you pointed out, I believe it," Darella said. "Please, this is very important to us, and we even need to find our other companion before we leave."

Lamaramakama continued to look down at them with a large grin. He tapped the side of his head-like area with one of his fingers, then spoke. "Okay. You can have it if you can get it. But you're still down there, and I'm up here, and there's a lot of imagination between us. Please, be my guest to earn back the existence of the material plane." With that, Lamaramakama ducked back in the window.

"Well, there goes our guide. It's just you and me," Darella said. Mareak offered a fist bump, which Darella took. "So, do you see an entrance to the keep anywhere?"

"No," Mareak replied, "but I think there's one on the backside, probably minimally protected. Let's take a look."

The two walked around the keep clockwise. Mareak reached out to touch the wall, and though it was not as solid as stone, it felt hard to the touch, unlike the ground beneath him. On the back side of the keep, they found a door as predicted. Darella approached the door and reached out towards the handle, but Mareak put his arm in front of her to stop her.

"Wait," he said. "Please, since when do we _just_ open doors? Allow the rogue to go to work." 

Darella backed away from the door. Mareak kneeled up close to the door and looked carefully at the handle. To the average onlooker, it appeared normal, but up close, Mareak could see the slightest twinkle to it. He backed away and began fishing around in his pack.

"I think it's electrically charged," he said. "Our best bet is to ground it to neutralize the trap." From his pack, he found a length of rope-like wire. He took one end and buried it partway under the ground into the pink-purple. With the other, he formed a loop, which he began to swing around like a lasso. In one smooth motion, he tossed and released the loop towards the door. When the loop caught on the handle, they heard a "zap" in the air, and the wire smoked slightly.

"Good work," Darella said as Mareak began to reel the line in. He formed a coil again, threw it back into his pack, then approached the door as normal and opened the door.
