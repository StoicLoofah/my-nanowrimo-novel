8. Plus One

"Hey Wayne!," Carl said when he opened the door. Despite the December chill outside, he saw 2 smiling faces on his doorstep. "I take it this is your sister."e

"Yes, sir," Wayne said. "Carl, this is my sister Hannah. She's in junior high." Carl extended his hand. "Hannah, this is Carl, our dungeon master." Hannah stretched out a mitted hand.

"Hi, Carl!," Hannah said with an excited handshake. "Wayne always talks about how much fun he has playing games with you, so I wanted to check it out."

"Oh, of course. We're always happy to have more people join us," Carl said. "Please come in." He stepped out of the doorway to let them enter. "What grade are you in?"

"6th. Should I take my shoes off?" Carl waved his hand in indifference, so Hannah left them on and took her coat off.

"Well, Lindsay is already here, so we're just waiting on Drew at this point. This way," Carl said as he started going up the stairs. The others followed and entered the game room, where a Christmas tree was setup in the corner. Lindsay hung over the armrest of a couch to look at the newest visitors. "Help yourself to any of the cookies on the side table over there. And there's a drink fridge next to the TV if you get thirsty."

"Lindsay, this is my sister Hannah," introduced Wayne. "She will be joining us today, though I'm not sure if she will be playing or not."

"Pleased to meet you, Hannah," Lindsay said. "You should definitely play; it's so much fun. But more importantly, how's your math?"

"Uh, good," Hannah replied, somewhat confused. Wayne laughed.

"Not fair," he said. "My family is going with a no-pressure strategy for what she wants to do." Wayne turned to address Hannah. "Of course, we're totally behind you whatever you want to do. Lindsay's a math nerd, Drew is a debator, Carl is in band, and you know what I do, so there's a lot of talent around the table."

"...except in-game decision-making," said Carl as he arranged papers on the table. "I believe all of you lack talent there. Now that I'm thinking about it, though, how did state go?"

"Great," said Wayne. "Most importantly, no more rules about these guys," he said, holding a handful of Christmas cookies. "But yeah, I finished in the top 10 at the state meet."

"Congratulations!" Lindsay said. "That's huge with all of your college apps out, right?" Wayne nodded.

"Yeah, the whole family is super-proud of Wayne," Hannah said. "He's pretty much the family superhero."

"Well, I think that's exaggerating," Wayne replied. "The race day conditions weren't that great, but I think that affected most runners more than me, so it actually worked out pretty well. And I'm glad that cross country finishes before college applications are due because I can put it on there."

"Hey guys," Drew said from the top of the stairs. The others turned and gave him a smattering of greetings. He looked over at the snack table, then down at the plate he was carrying. "Oh, looks like we're going to have a lot of cookies. But we also have a lot of people today! You must be Wayne's sister: Hannah, right?" Hannah nodded enthusiastically.

"This is Drew," Wayne said. "Props on remembering her name, by the way."

"Well, I'm sure I probably forgot some important Greek historian to keep tha fact stashed in here," he said, tapping his skull with his index finger. "Sorry to interrupt. You were talking cross country? Congrats on your finish: I saw it in the school paper."

"Thanks, Drew," Wayne replied. "Nah, we were pretty much done talking about that. What's new with you?"

Drew poured himself a glass of milk to go with his cookies. "Nothing interesting. We have a really big debate tournament coming up this month, and we're way behind on prep. As I said, not interesting." Drew walked over to take a seat and noticed that no one was saying anything. "Okay, totally not killing the conversation today. How were Thanksgivings? Did Marie come back?"

"Yeah..." Carl said, elongating the word with a downward pitch. He nodded his head slowly.

"Okay, you have to tell us what happened," Lindsay said. She leaned in.

"Is this high school drama?" Hannah whispered to Wayne. Wayne nodded and waited for a story.

"Uh, it was okay," said Carl. He paused again to think. "Well, it just wasn't really the same. I can't really pinpoint anything in particular, but I feel like we weren't talking to each other as well. More just like we were in the same room and talking, you know?"

"Oh boy," Lindsay said. She fell backwards into the couch cushion. Carl gave her an alarmed look. "You know that Thanksgiving is a pretty big deal in college relationshp transitions, right?"

"No," Carl replied. He shifted his eyes quickly. "I don't really know if I want to hear more."

"Well, you should know." Lindsay leaned forward again and put her elbows on her knees. "Tons of breakups over Thanksgiving. Tons over Christmas. If you make it past that, things start looking clearer, but it's a rough ride."

"Woah, hold on," Drew said. "Lindsay, I'm not saying you're not dating-worthy, but I would like to point out that you have never had a boyfriend just to question your authority on the matter."

"Not answering that," she said to Drew without looking at him. "Carl, good communication for the next few weeks, okay? Don't panic: just good communication."

"Yeah. Okay. Thanks," he said distractedly. Carl looked back up at his players. "Hannah, I promise there usually isn't this much drama."

"That's okay," she said. "Good luck with Marie."

"Thanks. Should we get started?" he asked. "Hannah, have you determined whether you want to play or not?"

"Not sure," she replied. "Can I maybe watch for awhile and join later? Wayne described it to me, but I'm not sure I get how all the numbers in fighting work."

"Yeah, totally," Carl said. "Just let me know when you're comfortable playing, and I'll work you into the story. And don't worry too much about the rules. I'm the DM, and what that means is that you tell me what your character is going to do, and I figure out how to make that work fairly with the rules."

"He's really good at putting up with crazy ideas," said Wayne. "Speaking of which, I would like to recognize Lindsay for some bold decision-making last game. That was very impressive."

Lindsay stood up and began to do a series of bows to her clapping audience. "Thank you, thank you," she said.

"Yeah, nicely done. Hannah, as explanation, the party needed to get an item from a friend hopefully without hurting him, and Lindsay remembered a trap I had put in the week before and used that to do it. Pretty clever move worth bonus experience points." Lindsay pumped her fist and sat down.

"Okay, where do we get started, then?," Drew asked.

"Let's skip the walk and start at the Sideways Tower," said Carl. "It took you a few days to walk, but everything looks normal. You arrive during the middle of the day and are standing outside."

"We stil have the Seed of Eternal Summer, right?" asked Wayne.

"No, you don't. You have the Seed of Eternal Spring," corrected Carl.

"Same thing."

"No, not really, but whatever. Let's get started. Drew, why don't you start?"
