"I can't find any traps." Mareak stood up, and his face reappeared in the flickering light before the door. He wiped some dust off of his fingers as he walked back to his 2 fellow adventurers. "It doesn't help that you lost my kit of thieves' tools earlier, but hey: you're going through first anyways, so I'm sure the gods will be just."

"I told you already: I didn't lose them. I thought the gnome was very trustworthy, and he will bring them back." Yennhorn leaned his short sword against the stone wall and cast his torch forward again. He carefully stepped up to the door, listened for a moment, then slammed his body against it. The wood popped, and the door crumpled open. "It's just another empty room." He walked back, picked up his short sword, then stepped through into the next chamber.

"How is there nothing of interest? We have been down here for 2 days," said Darella. A druid of the forest, Darella was the least comfortable of the three to be crawling through dungeons. "I'll look around and see if I can find anything useful."

There was yet another door forward, opposite the one they had entered from, but the hallway was just as likely to have more enemies ahead. Yennhorn already stood close to the door, listning for any sound for guidance. Darella walked slowly along the perimeter of the room, looking for any hints of what else may be around. Although she found little interest in masonry, a patch of moss or the occasional vermin could tell her much about the design of the dungeon. As she passed her fingers along the wall, she felt a slight breeze coming seemingly from the stones itself. It smelled fresh, which was a refreshing change.

"Guys, get over here," she said, not bothering to gesture. She pushed herself closer to the wall.

Mareak swiftly crossed the room, providing his own torch for additional light. His elven eyes crossed over the wall several times, then stopped. "I think there's a secret door here." Darella stepped back, and she followed Mareak's finger as he motioned the outline of the door with his index finger. "Yennhorn, can your body smash down a stone wall too? I think our treasure is near. There are markings in the masonry that read something ancient."

"Yeah, I bet that the dwarves left a giant 'Treasure here' sign in script. Let me take a look," responded Yennhorn. Although somewhat worn, the script was clearly in ancient Dwarven, and though Dwarven was not typically part of a Halfling's education, he was always exceptionally smart.

"It says, 'Peril for those ahead'." He spoke slowly as he worked over the script. "'Do not take the source of life from us, and you will find friends. The path will be clear when it is least.'" Yennhorn turned to the others. "What does that mean?"

"I don't know. I'm not the genius of the death pits," Mareak responded.

"Look, that was a great idea. I'm sorry it didn't quite work out for your hamster," Yennhorn shot back. Their conversation quickly devolved as Darella stood in silence, thinking and thinking. She then closed her eyes, then raised her hands. As she lowered her hands again, their torches started to flicker out. The other two noticed and broke their bickering.

"Not cool. We are running low on torches, and we lose stuff in the dark." Yennhorn sighed as they stood in the dark, waiting.

Suddenly, the wall before them began to glow a dark red. Darella opened her eyes and looked at the other two without the slightest bit of annoyance. The red light illuminated their faces as the stone changed shape. The rough parts of the stone changed to leaves, and soon, the entire door appeared to be no more than a hedge, which subsequently retreated away to reveal a new chamber. 

They heard the rush of water and could make out the outline of more plants, but most importantly, on a dais in the center of the room lay a bright jewel: the Ruby of Eternal Light.
