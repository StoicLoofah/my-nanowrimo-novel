19. Showdown
================

Dungeon Investigators Inc. ran forward between the red markings all across the market. Malafar's avatar in the middle continued to wave his hands in some spell. The hellhounds noticed the party charging at them and readied themselves in formation. Before the clash, however, the avatar held out a single hand as a stop. The party felt an immense will against them, and they all slowed to a stop. The hellhounds also relaxed.

"Don't approach," the avatar said. Though he spoke seemingly calmly and quietly, the party could hear him clearly over the chaos in Ryden around them. "Malafar approaches, and I assure you, this will not end well for you." The fissure behind him continued to glow and seemed to get steadily brighter.

"I wouldn't feel so good about your chances after our last run-in," Yannhorn replied. "Put your hands up, and maybe you'll get a fair trial. Maybe not."

The avatar put his hands in the air as commanded, but his eyes turned red. Missiles of pure energy shot out of his eyes and hit Yannhorn squarely in the chest, blasting him back and leaving a scorch mark on his armor.

"Not cool," Yannhorn said. "Let's get him!" He charged at the hellhounds.

"Wait, we need a better plan!" Mareka yelled. "We need to focus on the fissure!" Yannhorn continued to barrel forward. "Darella, we'll take care of the dogs," Mareak yelled as he started moving forward following Yannhorn. "You deal with that guy!"

Darella nodded and kneeled to touch the ground. A word later, the dirt began to slide up and encase her body in a makeshift armor. She looked up again straight at the avatar, who was staring at her, now with her arms forward, ready to duel. 

She put her club away and reached into her pouch. "And these are the moments I wish we had a wizard," she muttered to herself.

Yannhorn speared one of the hellhounds instantly on his initial charge, then immediately backed away. Remembering that he had lost his shield earlier, he wielded his sword more cautiously to deflect away any attacks in his direction. Seconds later, Mareak came up to his side.

"Do you have a plan?" Mareak asked. They stood back to back and waited as the hellhounds surrounded.

"I tank, you kill," Yannhorn replied. Mareak nodded. He put a dagger away and reached into his belt for a vial. He took a sip and flashed out of view.

Seeing only one enemy left, the hellhounds pounced. Yannhorn swung his sword wildly and screamed curses and war crys at them. They bit at him, partially melting parts of his armor, and they clawed and scratched between his parries, but his warrior training kept him focused beneath the swarm. Still, Mareak was nowhere to be seen.

The avatar drew a large circle with his hands, and a transparent, blue sphere appeared around him. Although Darella wasn't familiar with arcane magic, she recognized the sphere of protection that would ward away simple magic. In response, she scattered seeds along the ground in front of her, and huge tentacle-like vines sprouted instantly. Some of them lashed out at the avatar but were rebuffed by the sphere.

The avatar started to twist his hands around each other. Darella saw him chanting, and inside of his hands, she saw a flickering. Before she could fully recognize the spell, a fireball shot out of his hands towards her. She dove to the side as it shot between the vines and then exploded. Quickly, she looked down at her body to see her mud armor still intact. Some of the vines had been burnt to ash, but other remained strong.

The avatar continued his attack and acid arrows formed from behind him and launched out at Darella. The vines swung back and forth to knock away the arrows, but several got through and came dangerously close to Darella. She then looked up to the sky and tried to ignore the arrows flying around her. She pulled out a metal key from her pack and held it up to the sky. She focused hard on the words that she had used so many times, and she heard thunder from above. Then, she swung the key around and pointed it at the avatar.

At the same moment, an arrow caught her in the right leg. It instantly dissolved into a burning feeling, but it had done its work and knocked her slightly off-balance. Lightning came down from the sky and struck several feet beside the avatar. He stumbled back several steps, deafened, but himself was untouched other than his hair standing on edge. More importantly, however, Darella saw that the sphere of protection was gone.

Yannhorn continued to fight off the hounds, but the 6 of them around him were too much. He would see an opportunity to strike, but then be batted from behind and have to pull his swing back just short. His vision became hazy as he felt everything heating up more and more, then he saw a blur from behind one of the hounds.

In one action, Mareak struck down into the skulls of two hellhounds with his daggers. He reappeared instantly when he began his attack, but his shape remained a blur. Methodically, he worked his way around the circle of hellhounds, who had no time to react to his series of quick, surgical strikes. Within seconds, Yannhorn was alone as the hellhounds all fell to the sides. Together, their bodies lit up. Yannhorn staggered out of the circle and looked back to see the corpses disappear.

"Well done, Yannhorn," Mareak said. Yannhorn slumped onto Mareak, then sat.

The avatar was momentarily dazed, then saw Darella again. He weaved his hands in a new pattern, and more missiles appeared. These lanced out at Darella, who only barely escaped harm. The missiles came faster and faster, and when Darella tried to cast her next spell, her concentration was broken by the onslaught. Meanwhile, the vines were slowly being picked off as they absorbed more and more of the damage.

Darella tried to cast another spell, but then she felt her armor slosh back to the ground as dirt. She was exposed to all of the spells that the avatar would sling at her.

Defiantly, she began to run towards the avatar. He laughed and continued to sling spells, but then she saw her features begin to change. He focused his spells increasingly upon this undodging force, but she continued and gained speed with each one. Now only 10 feet away, he no longer saw a druid: he saw a wolf.

Darella sprung forward, paws outstreched and landed squarely on the avatar's chest, knocking him back. Her fur was singed, and several parts were burned down to the bone, but her feral energy drove her to attack. In seconds, the avatar was torn apart and lay almost still on the ground, bleeding out.

She backed up several steps and began to morph back into human form. Mareak came up dragging Yannhorn along on the ground to see this pale figure lying on the ground.

He laughed, coughed, and grimaced. "You're too late," he said triumphantly.

"Too late?" Mareak asked. "I think your time has already passed."

"No," he said cryptically. "Too late to stop that." He brought his arm up and let it fall back to point at the fissure. His eyes rolled back lifelessly, but the party was no longer looking at him.

From the fissure, they saw an intense glow turn into a yellow, blinding light as a shape emerged. They shielded their eyes, and when they looked again, they saw a giant beast standing upright before them. It was 10 feet tall with thick, bat-like wings behind it. Its red skin bristled, and between two massive horns on its head were eyes that glowed red without pupils. In its hands, it held a whip of fire and a massive sword.

"This world ends," it said in a bellowing voice. "This plane meets Malafar."

---

The party was momentarily transfixed as they look up at the demon they had indirectly battled for so many years. Yannhorn groaned, and Darella looked to see him in great pain.

"Mareak, keep the demon occupied," Darella said as she reached into her pouch and began casting healing spells on Yannhorn.

"Pleasure to meet you," Mareak cried out. "I don't know if you know us, but we're Dungeon Investigators Inc., and we're not going to let you take down this plane."

"You are no one!" Malafar said derisively. Flames spat out from his mouth as he spoke. "You are only here to witness the end." Malafar held both hands above his head, and the markings on the ground glowed again. A pulse emerged from Malafar, and in concentric rings, the markings glowed. When the pulse the edge of the markings, the ground began to roll. From inside the markings, Mareak watched as the earth turned inside-out around the market and rippled outwards. Buildings were tossed into the air, and seconds later, Ryden sank again into more destruction.

"Those are only the beginning," Malafar said. "Here, the damage may even be small as the ground will literally break apart many nations away from here. You shall all crumble and fall!"

Mareak looked over at Darella who was completing another healing spell. Yannhorn's armor was still mangled, but the halfling inside looked to be in better shape. Mareak called out to Malafar, "We're ready! We have been collecting and finding the essence of this plane to drive you back. You have no grounding on this plane!"

"Your baubles mean nothing against my power!" Malafar said. His eyes burned, and each of them felt the heat on them. Each of them reflexively pulled out their totems: the Seed of Eternal Spring, the Sphere of Eternal Will, and the Flame Diamond. The Seed of Eternal Spring erupted in flame, and the Sphere of Eternal Will shattered into pieces. Darella threw the seed away, and Yannhorn recoiled from the shrapenel, and Malafar laughed again.

"How did you three mortals even imagine that you could challenge my will?" Malafar asked. The party stood firm, staring upwards at the massive demon.

"We're not backing down now," Yannhorn cried out. In that moment, he felt a surge of energy, sat up, and charged at Malafar with his sword raised high.

Malafar effortlessly flicked his whip, and the end of it snapped and knocked Yannhorn back several yards in the air. Malafar laughed, then raised his hands again. The markings pulsed again, and another wave of destruction rippled out from the market.

Yannhorn charged again with his sword up, but Malafar swung with his own sword. Yannhorn held his sword up to deflect it, but the force drove him backwards into the ground.

"We need a plan," Darella said as she ran up to Yannhorn. "And where the hell did Mareak go?" She looked around, but he was gone.

While Yannhorn stood, Malafar continued to call more waves of destruction that tore the world apart.

"We just need to keep him focused on us," Yannhorn said. "I don't know what Mareak is doing, but I'm hoping he's going to win this one for us." He shook his head with skepticism. "And even if not, we'll at least delay this world destroying thing."

Darella nodded. "I'll do what I can." She reached into her pouch and pulled out piece of honeycomb. She worked her magic over it, then flung it at Malafar. Midflight, it evolved into an entire hive, and a flood of bees began to emerge from it, all launched towards Malafar. He swatted them away without much difficulty, but amidst the chaos, he stopped his spell.

Yannhorn took the distraction and charged again. When Malafar noticed him, he swung hard with his sword, but Yannhorn dove to the side. At around his knee level, Yannhorn stabbed into Malafar, who appeared to feel nothing. He brought his whip around and knocked Yannhorn back again. He then began to whirl his whip in the air, slicing and breaking up the pack of bees.

Darella began another spell, but Malafar cracked his whip and broke her concentration. He brought his arms up again, letting loose another pulse. Seeing Yannhorn and Darella in disarray, Malafar moved away from the edge of the fissure and began to walk forward towards to with both weapons ready. 

"Bad move, buddy," they heard Mareak say. Malafar turned out to see Mareak standing at the edge of the fissure, holding the Flame Diamond, which radiated tremendous light. Malafar watched as Mareak dropped it straight into the fissure. It clinked downwards into the portal, and Malafar's eyes widened.

The fissure immediately darkened, and Mareak smiled with delight. Malafar rose his hands in the air, and nothing happened. He growled his displeasure and turned to charge at Mareak. Several steps in, however, the ground began to sink.

Mareak realized his poor positioning and began to run away from the fissure. Malafar lashed out with his whip and held Mareak bound by the flame.

"I could use some help now!" Mareak said as he felt the heat. "My part of the plan is over!"

The ground continued to slide towards the fissure, but Malafar stood still. He brougt the whip in, bringing Mareak closer to the range of his sword. He brought his sword up to cleave Mareak, but as he brought it down, Yannhorn run up and severed the whip. The flame died out instantly, and Mareak rolled to the side as the sword came crashing down beside him.

With his free hand, Malafar slapped Yannhorn away, knocking him back and out of the battle. Darella pulled more seeds out of her pouch and threw them at Mareak. She called another spell, and they sprouted into more vines that latched onto the ground and Malafar. The ground continued to slide away into the fissure.

Malafar snarled and tried to step forward, but the vines held him back. He back to cut back and forth across them, easily slicing himself away from them, but the distraction was enough for Mareak. He pulled out the Dagger of the Moon, which he drove deep into the back of Malafar's leg.

Mareak grinned at his success, but Malafar kicked him violently before he could pull the dagger out. Forunately, Mareak was knocked away from the fissure and towards Darella, who helped him up and watched Malafar struggle.

Malafar clutched at the wound, which began to froth and turned a cold white. He tried to move forward again, but he grimaced again. The white began to expand and covered a large portion of his leg. He reached in deep and pulled the dagger out, but it was too late. The earth gave way beneath him, and he fell backwards into the fissure. Everything was silent for a moment, then the fissure exploded, sending a huge plume of black ash into the air. The market was torn apart as the party was flung far from the center of the battle.

---

"Guys, I think we won," Yannhorn said, lying on his back. Mareka spat something out of his mouth and sat up.

"Good job saving the world," Mareak said unenthusiastically as he looked around. Ryden had been flattened in the battle, and in his head, he could see the damage that had likely been doing too the rest of Shermland, if not beyond.

Darella tried to walk it off. "You know, I think I could probably retire to a peaceful druid circle now. There's still that opening in Folkwood Forest, right?" The others laughed, and they were silent again.

Yannhorn shook his head. "I thought we could actually do it. I thought we could save the entire world and stop Malafar dead in his tracks. How could we have let this happen?"

They were quiet again, and they continued to survey the damage around them. They then noticed a small elven boy in tattered clothing run up to them.

"Help," he said to them, breathing heavily. He had ash smeared across his face and various cuts on his body. "My family: they're trapped in my house, and there are evil dogs all around. I haven't seen anyone else in the streets. You have to come!" He looked at them desperately.

Mareak sighed. "Once more?" The others nodded, and they stood up together.

The boy smiled briefly, but the look of alarm came back. "This way! Hurry!" He scampered off, and the party began to follow him in a slow jog.

"I guess we're never done," Yannhorn said.

"Never," Darella replied. "Maybe the world looks completely different from when it did yesterday, and maybe we just reached the end of this campaign, but there's always something ahead."

Mareak smiled and pulled out his daggers. "I hope we're ready."

"We're not," Yannhorn said confidently. The others looked at him quizzically, and he shrugged. "But let's go for it anyways."
