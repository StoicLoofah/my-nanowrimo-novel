Writing observations
====================

1. How do you balance dialog against action? Are my characters talking too much?
2. Have I used "said" too many times? Should I try to describe what they said with the verb, or is that redundant?
3. Do my characters all sound different enough, or do they all just talk like me?
4. Grammar is hard.


Revisions
====================
1. mix in more over and under confidence in Yannhorn
2. other should give him a harder time for being small
