5. Finding 
=============================

The party woke up in the mid-morning when a server set down breakfast in their sitting room. Darella went out to meditate in a nearby park to recover her spells while Mareak and Yannhorn checked their gear and supplies. Within the hour, they headed out towards the sideways tower to hear the next part of their task.

The door and voice greeted them again on arrival and ushered them into the waiting room. Inside, they found Feenious in a haze of dust. He would rapidly take the top book off of a stack, leaf through the pages, then toss it over his shoulder. Whether by skill or magic, each book landed perfectly on another pile on the other side of the room.

"I think things turned out badly the last time we disrupted his research," said Mareak.

"Yeah, I think you have been turned into a chicken," guessed Darella. "Let's just sit down and let him finish." They all gingerly walked over to the couches, ducking when Feenious swung his arm to toss a book, and sat down to walk the rest of the action.

Yannhorn felt a slight tickle in his nose, which he tried to wipe away, but the dust in the room kept working. He warned the other, "This is going to be ba-achoo!"

Feenious was mid toss and threw the book off balance straight into Yannhorn's face. He turned to look at the other and raised his arms to cast a spell.

"No, no, no," yelled Darella as she ran up to him with her hands up to stop him. Feenious looked at her, then relaxed. He looked back at Yannhorn, then sighed.

"Your fault," he said unapologetically, then walked over to pick up the book and put it in its place. "You should have let me know you were here. What if you were a pack of thieves? Who knows what treasures they may have taken." At that moment, Mareak put a fancy piece of machinery back on the side table next to him.

Yannhorn rubbed his forehead then spoke. "Okay, so we're here like you asked us to be. What next horror do you have ready for us? Horse-sized ants?"

"Hah, no, that's ridiculous. Everyone knows that ants can only grow about as large as dogs." Feenious snapped his finger and a book shot out from a corner of the room into his hands. He flipped past a few pages and ran his finger down the page. "Still, here we are.

"As I mentioned last time, our confrontation with Malafar is near, and you must carry items with great energy from the material plane with you. It's hard to know exactly what the nature of these types of objects are, but I believe that one of them is quite near in the Folkwood Forest."

"Oh, I love Folkwood. The druid circle there is quite friendly," Darella said excitedly.

"Yeah, quite friendly to other druids. I remember spending an entire adventure in a cage trying to determine if the mouse in the cage with me was a polymorphed druid I was supposed to befriend, or just a mouse," lamented Yannhorn. 

"Well, I'm sorry you were unable to ascertain the purpose of that test," said Feenious with an amused grin. "Hopefully they will be more welcoming to you this time. Still, I do not believe that the druid circle itself possesses the item we are looking for, or else they would have come forward with it sooner. Do any of you happen to remember any items of importance from there?" Darella and Yannhorn shook their heads.

"Uh, was it that vase?" asked Mareak.

"No, I think that was in Stormhorn Province," replied Darella.

"I believe that the vase was from the labrynith, but that is neither here nor there," said Feenious. "But let's get back on track here. Well, if you don't remember anything, that's fine. I'm sure it will reveal itself."

"Payment?" asked Mareak.

"Maybe 400 gold pieces?" Mareak shrugged at this suggestion then look off to the side. "400 gold pieces, that clock sitting beside you, and a promise to forget your attempted larceny." Mareak gave him a toothy grin, nodded, and began quickly packing up.

"One more thing: be careful. I heard that there is trouble in the area. Reports are scarce, but that's all the more reason for caution."

Folkwood Forest was a 3 day walk from Ryden, and the party took it leisurely. Having done a mostly good job for various Shermish citizens, they had good company on the road and warm places to stay all along the way. The day before heading into the forest, they decided to stop early and rest at the Burned Skillet, an inn on the edge of Folkwood Forest.

"Oh my, is that Dungeon Investigators Inc. I see?" asked an old woman behind the desk, squinting through her glasses.

"Hi, Miranda. It's so good to see you again," said Mareak warmly. He walked over to the desk and gave her frail body a gentle hug. "Please tell me you have the heroes suite available right now." She winked at him and reached under the desk. She grabbed a keyring, jingled it, and handed it over to Mareak. "You're a saint, you know that? We're going to drop our things off in the room and come back down, and then you can tell me all about your grandchildren." The others picked up their gear and headed for the stairs with Mareak.

"You know," started Yannhorn, "one day, she is going to find out one day that her husband didn't die valiantly fighting at your side, and that you actually backstabbed him."

Mareak just shrugged and continued walking without a word.

After they had taken off their gear and rested their feet from the walk, they went back down for dinner, where meatloaf and ale were being served. Since the Burned Skillet was at a border, it attracted a variety of people: hunters from the forest, dwarves coming up the royal trade route, occasional more wild species, and everything in between. The party enjoyed many stories as the bard was out sick, and other patrons were taking turns on stage. The mood was generally festive, but the evening continued on, and by the end, the party was one of the few groups left, and they sat sipping their last pints in a corner with a ranger, Brendel. He was wrapped in a tattered cloak, and his dark beard appeared to have no been trimmed recently.

"So you have told me many stories of your past journey, but not why you have come here now," Brendel observed. "Please, enlighten me."

The party, previously talkative and excited, turned serious with the question and looked at each other for guidance.

"No matter," said Brendel. "I can see that you all are pure of heart and have a quest of grave importance at this moment. I have some news that may be of help to you." Brendel drew a long sip from his drink before directing his attention at Darella. "Lady druid, were you aware that the druids of Folkwood are no longer present?"

"What? No," Darella exclaimed with concern. "They were the caretakers of this region. What caused them to leave?"

"That I know not," Brendel responded. His voice was deep and soft, and Darella was calmed by it. "What I do know is that their absence has thrown the whole forest into disarray. The gnolls have become more aggressive, and the dryads have have had to respond in kind. Large swaths of the forest are reduced to ashes, and more trappers have gone missing recently.

"Clearly your quest is not to deal with this situation, or you would have been more forthcoming and less surprised at these relevations. Whatever your purpose may be, however, I recommend caution as this area is already unstable."

"Perhaps it is not our original purpose, but clearly the gnolls must be dealt with," said Darella. "Gnolls are notorious for their raids on peaceful people. The dryads are simply protecting the forest." The others nodded in agreement.

"These issues are not so simple. I'm surprised that even you druid so wholly subscribe to this view," said Brendel. Darella frowned at this rebuke. "You will see more of this issue soon, I'm sure, so I hope it will suffice to point this out. The previous druids were content to allow the gnolls to exist here. Perhaps they had a reason in that.

"Pardon me, but I must now be moving onward. Be at peace with nature, druid, and may you and your companions be safe." Brendel stood up quietly and walked out of the inn into the night.

"What was up with that guy?" asked Yannhorn. "He was clearly way too cool to explain anything to us."

"I don't really know," replied Darella as she drummed her fingers on the wooden table. "I think this situation may get very complicated quickly. Let's head to bed as well and see what's ahead of us."

---

The party woke up before dawn to pack and prepare for the rest of their trip. They left as the sun began to rise and before Miranda could hold them up in conversation. The stretch of road to the forest was uneventful, and they walked in silence. Soon, they arrived at the tree line and looked in.

"So, what's the plan?" asked Mareak. "I'm hoping one of you two has a better idea than I do about what we're looking for and how we're going to find it." Yannhorn shrugged.

"I think we should find the druid circle," replied Darella.

Yannhorn raised an eyebrow. "I thought we already found out that no one is home."

"Perhaps. Admittedly, my initial plan and hope was that we could convene with the other druids, but even if they are gone, perhaps they have left a trace of what caused them to leave. I feel as though their disappearance and our item should be linked." Yannhorn still had a skeptical look on his face. "Look, there's no where else obvious to go. I can easily find the druid circle, and maybe we'll find more paths from there."

Yannhorn stared for a second, then shrugged again. He gestured with an outstretch hand into the forest, and Darella went in first.

Darella was reinvigorated by being in the forest. As she walked, she was constantly looking around, smelling trees, kneeling to look at fungus, and waving at creatures walking by. Several birds landed on her shoulder and seemed to be in conversation with her. These sometimes led to a change of course, which the other two simply had to trust. Mareak's keen elven ears noticed animals at times following or watching them, and though Darella reminded him to keep his dagger sheathed, he remained vigilant for danger.

After walking for several hours, they came across a clearing in the forest.

They entered the clearing and got a clear look at the structure within. The druid circle was about 20 yards across, and the stones stood 10 feet into the air. On the stones were a variety of ancient carvings of animals, people, and magical symbols. Although they had walked mostly over the bare forest floor, the clearing was covered with a fine, soft grass. 

"Well, this is the first interesting thing we have seen all day," said Yannhorn as they approached. "One tree is just like another to me, but this is something."

Mareak stopped just outside of the circle to admire the stones. "I would never have known that this spot was recently inhabited. You druids sure do treat the forest nicely."

"That we do," responded Darella. She walked in long, slow strides around the circle and ran her fingers over the stones as they passed each one. "Still, I would say that this almost appears to be a hurried exit by the druids. They didn't cast the proper wards when they left, so the stones aren't well-maintained. And you can see where they had collapsed their tents and swept away their meditation area." She pointed where these things apparently had been, but the others just shook their heads and agreed.

"Okay, well you can do your thing. Sweep the area and let us know what you find. I'll, uh, keep guard," said Yannhorn as he sat down against one of the stones and looked back into the forest. Mareak came over to Yannhorn, also sat, and began eating his lunch.

Darella walked around the circle several more times before heading to the center of the circle. She then sat cross-legged and began to meditate.

The other two casually chatted and waited. After an hour or so, they were both laughing and hardly paying attention to their surroundings when Mareak looked up with a confused look on his face. Yannhorn noticed, stopped laughing, and looed in the same direction.

"What's up?" he asked.

"Okay, maybe I'm going crazy," said Mareak, "but I think the trees are closer than they were a few minutes ago." Yannhorn gave him a skeptical look. "I know, but check it out. Before, the grass went right up to the edge of the clearing. Now, there are trees on the edge there." He pointed, and Yannhorn looked closer. He nodded and began to slowly rise. Both of them reached for their weapons lying on the grass.

When Yannhorn put his hand around the hilt of his short sword, the trees suddenly shook, and the branches swung forward. Their roots retracted, and they lurched towards the two of them. With a new sense of urgency, Yannhorn and Mareak brought their weapons around into a ready stance.

"Darella, we've got company!" Yannhorn yelled. He looked over his shoulder to Darella, who remained sitting in silence. He turned forward again to see several trees charging at them. Mareak glanced back at his dagger and had second thoughts about defending himself with it against a tree. As the trees neared, they stood poised, and as the lead tree lowered its upper trunks to knock them down, Yannhorn and Mareak lept out of the way. It ran straight into the stone and cracked against it.

Mareak sprang back up and ran towards Darella. Once he entered the middle of the circle, he saw that the trees were coming from all direction.

"Darella, wake up!" he yelled again, then shook her violently. Her eyes snapped open and looked perturbed at Mareak. "Trees! Moving! Help!" Mareak swung his arm around to point everywhere.

Darella followed his finger, then stood up. In a booming voice that seemed to originate from everywhere at once, she spoke in some foreign language full of gurgling and hoots. Yannhorn joined them and brought his sword and shield back up as they trees filtered between the stones of the druid circles and approached. Darella then stopped speaking, which made the trees stop as well. The only sound was the flutter of a light breeze as they trees remained still.

"What did you say?" asked Mareak.

"I'm not entirely sure. I _think_ it's a dryad greeting," said Darella with a questioning tone. A group of trees began to shift and stepped back to form an open corridor. A taller, thicker tree stepped forward and stopped to address them.

"Who knows the call of the dryads?" it said in deep and rumbling voice. No mouth moved to speak, but the sound clearly eminated from this tree. Knobs like eyes faced them and waited expectingly.

"That's me. My name is Darella Gellantara, and I am a druid of a forest far from here. We came in search of the druids who once inhabited this circle, but they are no longer here. And these are my companions, Yannhorn and Mareak. They're not druids, but they're okay anyways."

"I see. Please forgive our earlier behavior," it said. "You may call me Oakfoot. I am a guardian dryad, and since the druids left, we have been wary of strangers."

"Wary?" Mareak asked. "I think charging us for taking a breather is more than wary."

"That is what we seek forgiveness for," Oakfoot replied. "He is one of our younger, brasher members." He pointed at another dryad, who was missing several top branches and swayed about. "Please, come with us. We can some of what has happened here."

---

The party walked back through the forest with several of the dryads. Most of them had dispersed shortly after leaving the clearing, but a handful stayed with them, either for the company or as guards. Although the dryads moved slowly, they took large strides and led them at a normal walking pace.

"The forest has not been well since the druids left, or even since before that," began Oakfoot.

"Last winter was difficult. The freeze lasted longer than usual, and though we are tough trees, there can be other problems. The gnolls required more warmth than usual and attacked more frequently. The druids suffered greatly and could not bless the forest as they usually do. And when spring came, our numbers were not replenished as much as they usually are.

"We remained close with the druids to ensure that we could fluorish through these tough times, but the great druid, Aralynn, was called away for a council meeting."

"I heard about that," interrupted Darella. Oakfoot looked at her for details. "I don't remember what the problem was."

"Without the great druid," continued Oakfoot, "the rest of the druids made great effort to continue their practices, but there was dissent in their ranks. See, the druids had been entrusted with the Seed of Eternal Spring, which promises to help nature grow." The party looked at each other knowingly but said nothing.

"Some druids believed that they should use its power to help us. Others disagreed, claiming that its full power was not known and could be dangerous. I know not what happened next, but I had heard rumblings of a coming clash. One morning, we arrived at the druid circle, and the druids were gone.

"They left behind little, as you may have noticed, but they did leave behind one important thing: the Seed." As if on cue, they stepped into view of an area protected by patrolling druids. Within it was a flat surface made from the top of a downed tree, and on it sat a fist-sized seed. "We took it not knowing how to use it, but one of our wiser dryads suggested that we water it. When we did that, the trees around it sprouted leaves of dark green vigor.

"We do not know what magic makes it work, but we feel blessed to have it. We do not wish to abuse it, so we provide it only a drop per day. It is just enough so that our saplings can turn strong quickly."

The party and the trees came to a stop around the downed tree and looked at the seed. A dryad came to each of the party members and offered them a drink from a large, deep, cup-like leaf. They each took a drink of the clean water while they stared at the seed, waiting to see something amazing happen.

"This type of magic can be dangeous," said Yannhorn. "You know that, right?"

Oakfoot turned to Mareak. "What Halfling lore makes you believe that?"

"Well, it's pretty obvious," Yannhorn said. He coughed, cleared his throat, pointed at the seed, then continued. "If it was good for you, the druids would have let you have it long ago. Instead, they withheld it from you, and if I know one thing about druids, it's that they only withhold magic when it's dangerous. Right, Darella?"

"Uh, yes. What he said," Darella replied.

Oakfoot turned back and forth to look at the other dryads. "Perhaps you have a point. I have never known a halfling to lie. Would you be willing to safely remove it for us?"

"Totally," Mareak said, and he began to reach for the seed.

"Wait," said Oakfoot. Mareak froze mid-stretch. "Perhaps it is dangerous, but the gnolls are even more dangerous. They come and burn many of us. We will need the Seed of Eternal Light to continue to bolster our strength until they are defeated. Their leader is fearsome, and unfortunately, we are not able to ever get close to him. If you could eliminate him, however, we may no longer need this supposedly dangerous magic to deal with him."

Yannhorn spoke before the others had time to consider it. "Consider that a deal." He reached out his hand to shake Oakfoot's branch. "We'll get him, and then we'll take care of this Seed for you. Great deal for you. Let's do it. Just point us in the right direction, and we'll take care of your gnoll leader problem."

---

"What's going on?" whispered Darella. Mareak ducked back down into a crouch and rejoined Darella and Yannhorn hiding behind a log.

"I see maybe 4 gnolls down there," whispered Mareak back at them. "These guys are the real deal. Faces like dogs, furry all over, probably a head taller than myself, and they all have axes and armor."

"Do you think we can get around them?" asked Yannhorn.

"Probably not, unless you want to walk a few miles out of the way, and we'll probably come across another group. I think we're deep in gnoll territory right now. Our best bet is to take them down fast." Mareak looked at them for approval.

"Yeah, I think we can do that," Yannhorn said. "Mareak, if you can sneak to the side of them and draw their attention, I can close the gap. We can try to hit them at once." Mareak nodded slowly, then scampered off quietly.

Yannhorn took a couple deep breaths, then popped his head up to look at the gnolls. They hadn't moved much since they first saw them in the distance, but they didn't look unready, either. He quietly unsheathed his sword and readied his weapon.

"We're going to give these gnolls hell, right?" Darella asked. She held her club ready. Yannhorn gave her a thumbs up, then popped his head up to look again. On the far side of the gnolls, he saw Mareak poking his head around a tree trunk. He gave him the thumbs up too, then Mareak disappeared. They heard a crack come from Mareak's direction, and the gnolls all turned to look. The apparent leader barked something in some guttural language, and they began to approach Mareak. At that moment, Yannhorn hopped over the log and began charging down towards the gnolls.

Mareak dashed out from behind the tree, and the gnolls looked at him and began to pursue. With his downhill momentum, however, Yannhorn caught up first and caught a gnoll in the back with a pointed sword. His blade went through both sides of the gnoll's armor, and the both tumbled forward. Darella came up right behind Yannhorn and delivered a club hit to another gnoll's head, and he let out a yipp.

The gnolls turned back to their actual assailants and swung their axes. Darella sidestepped to avoid a slash, and Yannhorn, with his sword still lodged in the other gnolls, threw his shield up to block the axe. He took the hit and used the momentum to pull his sword out and get back to his feet.

The gnoll Darella first hit took a wild, disoriented swing causing Darella and another gnolls to both dive for cover. While on the ground, however, the gnoll was attacked by Mareak who dived on him with two dagger and applied the coup de grace.

Seeing two of his allies go down so quickly, the lead gnoll barked again, and he and his remaining ally turned to run. Darella reached into her pouch and tossed something at the tailing gnoll. Vines sprung from the ground and tangled up the gnoll's feet. He tripped and fell to the ground, and Mareak sprung on him as well.

"Don't let the last one get away!" yelled Yannhorn as he watched the gnoll run. The three of them began to pursue, charging through the forest. "He'll warn all of them!"

Then, the gnoll stopped 10 yards away from them and turned as though to fix. The three others stopped together and looked for an opportunity to attack. The gnoll snarled and began to slowly step to his right to find a better position.

"Put your weapon down, buddy, and we'll be lenient," suggested Mareak. The gnoll didn't react and continued to strafe. He gestured with his axe for them to come at him. "Alright, you are literally asking for it, buddy."

The three of the charged forward, but as they made it half way, they felt a string snap beneath them, and a net rose from the ground and hoisted them into the air. The three of them fell awkwardly into the net, with limbs and heads splayed out. Suspended 10 feet in the air, they slowly rotated, and they saw the gnoll step underneath them. He panted a couple times in laughter, then pulled a whistle out of his belt, which he blew.

"This is definitely your fault," said Yannhorn.
