1. Ruby of Eternal Light
========================

"I can't find any traps." Mareak stood up, and his face reappeared in the flickering light before the door. He wiped some dust off of his fingers as he walked back to his 2 fellow adventurers. "It doesn't help that you lost my kit of thieves' tools earlier, but hey: you're going through first anyways, so I'm sure the gods will be just."

"I told you already: I didn't lose them. I thought the gnome was very trustworthy, and he will bring them back." Yennhorn leaned his short sword against the stone wall and cast his torch forward again. He carefully stepped up to the door, listened for a moment, then slammed his body against it. The wood popped, and the door crumpled open. "It's just another empty room." He walked back, picked up his short sword, then stepped through into the next chamber.

"How is there nothing of interest? We have been down here for 2 days," said Darella. A druid of the forest, Darella was the least comfortable of the three to be crawling through dungeons. "I'll look around and see if I can find anything useful."

There was yet another door forward, opposite the one they had entered from, but the hallway was just as likely to have more enemies ahead. Yennhorn already stood close to the door, listning for any sound for guidance. Darella walked slowly along the perimeter of the room, looking for any hints of what else may be around. Although she found little interest in masonry, a patch of moss or the occasional vermin could tell her much about the design of the dungeon. As she passed her fingers along the wall, she felt a slight breeze coming seemingly from the stones itself. It smelled fresh, which was a refreshing change.

"Guys, get over here," she said, not bothering to gesture. She pushed herself closer to the wall.

Mareak swiftly crossed the room, providing his own torch for additional light. His elven eyes crossed over the wall several times, then stopped. "I think there's a secret door here." Darella stepped back, and she followed Mareak's finger as he motioned the outline of the door with his index finger. "Yennhorn, can your body smash down a stone wall too? I think our treasure is near. There are markings in the masonry that read something ancient."

"Yeah, I bet that the dwarves left a giant 'Treasure here' sign in script. Let me take a look," responded Yennhorn. Although somewhat worn, the script was clearly in ancient Dwarven, and though Dwarven was not typically part of a Halfling's education, he was always exceptionally smart.

"It says, 'Peril for those ahead'." He spoke slowly as he worked over the script. "'Do not take the source of life from us, and you will find friends. The path will be clear when it is least.'" Yennhorn turned to the others. "What does that mean?"

"I don't know. I'm not the genius of the death pits," Mareak responded.

"Look, that was a great idea. I'm sorry it didn't quite work out for your hamster," Yennhorn shot back. Their conversation quickly devolved as Darella stood in silence, thinking and thinking. She then closed her eyes, then raised her hands. As she lowered her hands again, their torches started to flicker out. The other two noticed and broke their bickering.

"Not cool. We are running low on torches, and we lose stuff in the dark." Yennhorn sighed as they stood in the dark, waiting.

Suddenly, the wall before them began to glow a dark red. Darella opened her eyes and looked at the other two without the slightest bit of annoyance. The red light illuminated their faces as the stone changed shape. The rough parts of the stone changed to leaves, and soon, the entire door appeared to be no more than a hedge, which subsequently retreated away to reveal a new chamber. 

They heard the rush of water and could make out the outline of more plants, but most importantly, on a dais in the center of the room lay a bright jewel: the Ruby of Eternal Light.

---

As the party walked into the room, they were seemingly transported to a completely different realm. Instead of the occasional drop of water, there were small waterfalls all around them. Their feet kicked up the soft dirt, and their body brushed past the ferns. The room wasn't bright, but the ruby and their torches provided enough light to see the ceiling disappear into clouds several feet above their heads.

"I think we took a wrong turn," said Yannhorn. Despite the serenity of the room, he held his sword and torch up and ready as though to fight off each branch.

"Relax. This is nature as true as it can exist. The Ruby provides the light, energy, and warmth as described by the wizard, and even the smallest life can fluorish in its presence." Darella stopped and took a deep breath in, then exhaled. "Don't you feel alive here? There truly is balance here."

"I couldn't care less about what it does. I care that the wizard cares what it's worth," said Mareak. He stepped ahead of the rest of them up and onto the dais and stood in front of the Ruby of Eternal Light floating at chest height. He knelt down to look at it at eye level and focused intensely on it. "Let's just take it and go. Do you think there are any wards on it? If only we had a wizard with us."

All three were silent for a moment after this comment.

Mareak broke the silence first. "Look, we'll just have to take a chance. I'll just throw a bag over it, and we'll head out." He turned to rifle through his backpack for an appropriate way to take it.

As Mareak moved about, Yannhorn noticed something move behind him, but when he turned, he could only see the plants. As Mareak's body threw different shadows around the room, however, the plants continued to shift, in an almost threatening manner.

"If you're going to grab it, just grab it," said Yannhorn. "This place is giving me the heebie jeebies." As he spoke, the room suddenly darkened as Mareak covered the Ruby. The Ruby and bag fell to the ground as the magical field dispersed. The dull thud was quickly followed by a grunt, then another thud. Mareak turned to see Yannhorn's torch fall to the ground. "This is your fault!" Yannhorn cried from the darkness.

Darella and Mareak heard a series of thwacks come from the darkness. Darella reacted first and grabbed the club off of her back and ran forward. Holding up her torch, she saw vines whipping forward and back and Yannhorn amidst it with his short sword in hand. Seeing this, she dropped her club and began to fumble around inside of a pouch for something.

Mareak looked at Yannhorn, then back down at the Ruby. Despite it being covered, he could still see a faint glow from inside the bag. He quickly came to his senses, however, grabbed and stuffed it in his pack, then ran forward to help out. Forgetting the dais, however, he stumbled when he missed the step down and fell flat against the dirt floor. Before he could push himself up, he felt a giant weight on his back. A massive leaf had seemingly flung itself onto him and was pinning him against the ground.

Darella could hear Mareak's cries for help, but she kept her eyes down until she felt a squishy, wet sphere in her pouch. Something flew by and cut across her left thigh, but she remained focused. Crushing the sphere into her palm, she began to chant and threw the guts of a crocodile eye into the air.

When she finished, a rush of air blew outwards from Darella and swept across the room. The vines and leaves recoiled back towards their previously static positions, except for the cut bits lying around Yannhorn. He sat up somewhat dazed, then put on a mock tough face. "I was fine, thank you. I was looking forward to the experience."

"Well, you might still get a chance." Darella picked up her club and looked up again. "The spell will only last for a moment. I suggest we get out of here right now lest those plants come after the light of their lives."

All three quickly checked their gear, then moved towards the exit. Fortunately, the gap remained.

"I'll be glad to get back to the dungeon," remarked Yannhorn. As they crossed the threshold, however, they noticed much more light encircling them. More importantly, they noticed the orcs holding the light encircling them.

"You take shiny," said a voice near the middle. A slightly better armed but otherwise normally greenish orc stepped forward. "Now we take shiny, and you stay. And no leave. Ever."

Yannhorn sighed.

"Look, I'm sure we can work out a deal here," suggested Mareak. He held his torch high above his head in his left hand in a gesture of peace, and he held his right hand open and forward. "I'm sure you also are on a contract to get the Ruby, but to be frank, we have no idea where it is either." 

"No deal. You lie. You give it now." The head orc looked as resolute as ever about it. Darella shifted uneasily and thought to say something, but closed her mouth as soon as she opened it. It was best to leave the talking to the best bluffer amongst them.

Mareak laughed. "Well, that's no way to talk amongst friends. I haven't accused you of being anything. Now, what makes you think that we have the Ruby?" 

One of the orcs snorted. The head orc pointed with his jagged, rusted sword at Mareak's pack. Mareak looked back and saw a faint red glow coming from a corner of his bag.

"Ah. Yes. That." As he talked, he turned back and forth to address all of the orcs. All 8, by his count. "That's not the Ruby. It's simply a toy for my daughter. Let me show you." As he reached around his body towards his back, he suddenly dropped the torch and grabbed a dagger hidden at his waist. In one smooth motion, he whipped it back across his body and flung it at the head orc.

It hit the orc standing next to the head orc square in the chest: the only where he wore armor. Rage filled the orc's face, and all of the orcs raced forward.

"Really good," Yannhorn shouted and he dropped his torch to pull his shield off of his back. Mareak and Darella dropped behind Yannhorn and pulled their weapons into ready position just in time to parry the first set of blows from the orcs.

The melee picked up quickly as weapons bounced back and forth. They exchanged minor blows, and though the adventurers held back most of the attack, they were sinking backwards towards opening they had just left. 

"We're not going back in there," cried Yannhorn. "I am not doing that, that living room again." The other two laughed while striking back at the orcs. 

Then, Darella's eyes widened with an idea. "Maybe you won't, but I will." She turned and dashed into the room as the orcs swung wide where she was. Mareak almost turned to curse her, but was cut off by a wild swing at his arm.

Thirty seconds passed as the other two remained hard-pressed to avoid injury, hoping that Darella had some brilliant idea. Then, vines shot out of the room and past their arms. Mareak almost screamed, but when he turned to deflect the next blow, he saw the orc before him being restrained by vines.

Darella came running out of the opening, hopping over a vine and past the melee towards the closed door forward. "Quickly!" she yelled. Mareak and Yennhorn looked at each other, then ran to follow after dealing parting gifts with their weapons to the restrained orcs.

"Okay, explanation required. What happened, and where are we going?" Mareak chased after Darella who had swung open the next door without consideration for what was behind it and ran in.

"One, druid magic way above your very short head. Two, I'm sure they have friends behind us. The only way is down."

---

They hurried through a series of rooms, busting down door after door to continue moving forward. They heard the battle continue behind them and only stopped after there was onlly silence. Panting, Yannhorn spoke first.

"Okay, I'm going to repeat Mareak's question: where are we going? You do realize that this is a _dungeon_, right? Dungeons don't have another exit at the bottom for all of the prisoners to stroll out of at their convenience."

Darella looked up, then looked down again. "Okay, maybe that wasn't the best idea. But I knew it wasn't safe back there, and this dungeon had been pretty empty until a few moments ago. I think we can probably wait this one out, then maybe head back in a few hours. Hopefully they won't be expecting that." She glanced up again for approval.

"Or maybe there are now orcs well-aware of what we rightfully took as our own and who will be searching the rest of this dungeon for us," Mareak pointed out. He dropped his pack and pulled out the Ruby. "He mentioned orcs. He did not mention the venus fly trap room. I think we can double our fee for this thing."

"How you can be talking about fees for this?" Yannhorn looked vaguely outraged, but maybe just resigned. "We're trying to save the world, not make a pretty penny."

"It makes perfect sense: the wizard is rich, and he clearly wants to save the world. If we succeed, then I'll be that much better off. If we fail, then our plane dissolves into nothingness, or so he claims. And then some gold won't offend anyone."

"Well, maybe the gods won't look so favorably upon that. Regardless, I think Darella is right. Let's wait. Darella, I'm a bit hurt: you take a look?"

Darella gestured for Yannhorn to drop his equipment, and she took a look at his arm. Seeing a rough cut, she pulled a powder out of her pouch and reached for her waterskin. Suddenly, the door behind them thumped, and Darella flinched, throwing the powder in Yannhorn's face.

He blinked, spat, and rubbed his eyes, and when he looked up again, a long vine had shot into the room and fallen limply several feet in front of him. He reached back to his sword and yelled something uncomprehensible while bringing his sword around. Darella had moved first and had picked up her gear and rearmed herself with her club. Mareak, however, was nowhere to be seen.

Another vine shot out, cracking the wooden door in two. Splinters shot out as only half of the door was left swinging on its hinges. The rest of it, however, disappeared as a massive swell of green pushed itself into the room. The party could only look in horror as the blob took shape, at least 10 feet tall, or maybe more as it squeezed itself into the room. Vines whipped around in front of it, with massive leaves shielding the core of it somewhere in front of them.

"I have not read about this one in the monster's manual," Yannhorn said as he looked up in awe. The vines poised themselves before the party in a momentary cease fire. This plant creature appeared to be staring at them, inspecting them, looking for something. Unsatisfied, it released a rattling, whooshing sound as the vines came for them again.

The first of the vines were sliced a single stroke by Yannhorn, but the rest landed, and together, they hit with enough force knock him back a few steps. Darella was doing better as she moved deftly in some sort of natural flow with the vines, dodging them and avoiding major harm.

"I think it figured out that we were the bad guys again," cried Darella. As she ducked, a vine the width of her forearm hit her in the back and knocked her to the ground. Seeing her down, Yannhorn planted his back foot, then launched himself forward, shield in front of him pushing through the vines and towards Darella. His sword worked off to his side, warding off any incoming vines from the beast itself, but just as he reached Darella, one made it through, looping around his ankle just enough to send him sprawling. Although his landing was soft, Darella let out a groan with her partner on her back.

Rolling around, they tried to get themselves ready for the next attack when the onslaught paused again. Just a few feet away, the vines encircled them. One particularly menacing vine inched forward, covered with red-blue leaves.

"That is poisonous," Darella said without emotion. She grabbed the torch now lying on the ground and waved it at the vine, but it continued its threatening approach, unafraid of the flame. As it reached an arm-length away, however, a red glint appeared off to their left. It flickered in an arc, and the vines suddenly turned to look, all moving in unison with the tumbling shape. It landed with a clink, and bounced, bounced, bounced again towards the corner of the room.

The vines shot off, suddenly disinterested in the humanoids they had pursued. Yannhorn and Darella looked alarmed and both stood to charge the heart of the beast when Mareak appeared in the torchlight before them, scroll in hand.

"We are totally out of here. Stay still." Both immediately obeyed their apparent savior and listened as he mumbled through some arcane-sounding text. Then, the scroll flashed and disappeared, and in a moment, they were all gone, too.

---

In the outskirts of Ryden stood an ancient tower. No one knew for how long it existed, but whoever built it truly understood architecture as 4 stories up, it suddenly turned 90 degrees and continued the next 10 stories horizontally without support.

Beside the tower stood a much less inspired outhouse, and on this quiet, sunny morning, its door suddenly burst open as three dirty bodies pushed themselves out and into full view.

"That was literally the worst thing that could have happened," hollered Yannhorn. "First, you disappear when we're attacked. _Then_, you throw away the one thing that could have possibly made the past 2 days worth it. _Then_, you misread a scroll and transport us to the outhouse. A _very_ valuable scroll that we will never find another one of." Yannhorn glared at Mareak, unsure of how they could possible recover this situation.

Mareak laughed. "Okay, you got me. That was not in the playbook, and I accept some blame. Yes, I may have misread a rune or two. Yes, that scroll maybe be irreplaceable. Yes, I hid when they attacked, but you kind of have to expect that from a rogue. But hey, look on the bright side." He reached back into his pack. "Literally." Out of his pack, he drew the Ruby of Eternal Light and tossed it up in the air in amusement. Less amusingly, it began to float midair, and he had to jump to grab it again.

"Wait, so what that thing we saw?" Darella asked, gesturing the bouncing light with her finger. Mareak smiled again.

"So I keep random rubies and other gems in my pack. Are you surprised?" His smile quickly disappeared, however. "But I only did this for the favor, of course. You both owe me your lives. Now let's go get paid." He held their stares for a moment, then turned towards the tower.

Walking up to the tower, a voice came out of nowhere as the door began to open. "Welcome back, Dungeon Investigators Inc." The party walked through without pausing for a step and into the room within. "Please wait."

They all slumped down into the chairs around the circular room. Filled with stacks of books several times their height, the room looked to be used primarily for storage, though with just enough space to receive guests. They sat in silence for several moments until they heard a twinkling sound, and a figure appeared in the middle of the room.

"Welcome back, Dungeon Investiagors Inc.!" he said. Dressed in all red, the wizard threw his hands above his head in excitement. He almost knocked the pointed hat off of his head as his white beard fluttered around in front of him.

"Hi Feenious," they said in unison, clearly well-practiced. They then sat in silence again.

"Well, do you have it?" Feenious said excitedly. He turned his head back and forth to look at each of them.

"I have it, and I want to be paid double." Mareak took it out and tossed it over to Feenious. It sailed, then floated gently to a stop in front of Feenious. "It was a lot of trouble."

Feenious reached out and held it in his hand preciously. "Yes, of course. Double, yes, I can do double. Especially for having delivered it so quickly. Please, tell me more," he said, almost disinterested as he focused almost entirely on the Ruby.

Darella began and recounted almost the entire tale of their last 2 days, through the dungeons, meeting the gnome, fighting plants and orcs, and through their recent arrival in his outhouse. Throughout, Feenious nodded vigorously but looked only at the Ruby.

"Wonderful," Feenious replied when Darella finished. "Well, I expected the demon to send agents on his behalf. No idea about the plants, though." Feenious waved a hand, and a pile of gold pieces appeared midair and sprinkled into a pile on the ground. All three of them launched themselves at the pile and began pouring coins into their packs. "Return later, and I will let you know the next step. I'm sure you will find something to spend these coins on. The market should be opening soon."
