17. The Tests
====================

As Dungeon Investigators Inc. approached the tower, the damage become more clear, and it was complete. The vertical part of the tower had imploded with rubble filling the inside of it. Within, they could see pages of books and parts of scaffolding sticking out, but there was nothing recoverable. The horizontal part was even worse off: it appeared to have been cleaved in whole from the base of the tower and fallen the several stories onto the ground. The impact or some other force had ripped the entire tower open, and its cylindrical form was no longer recognizable. Instead, there was just a long line of debris, and within, they could see aspects of the rooms. There were broken chairs, smashed mirrors, and scattered lab equipment. Worse, some of the chemicals had evidently started a fire, sending up a plume of chemical smoke.

"Feenious!" Yannhorn called out. 

"Welcome back, Dungeon Investigators Inc.," said a quiet voice in response. They looked around and approached the door. "I am very hurt."

"I can see that," Darella said, assuming the voice spoke on behalf of the tower. "What happened here?"

"I do not know," the voice replied, slowly. "My sensors did not sense the threat, but the result is obvious."

Yannhorn shook his head in shock. "What about Feenious? Where is he? Did he not know this was coming? How could he have not known?"

"Feenious?" The voice sounded shaken, regretful. "Feenious is gone. I no longer am linked to him."

"By the gods..." Mareak had no more words assuming the worst. Darella kneeled down, picked up some of the earth beneath them and began to pray. The party was silent for a moment.

"So what do we do now?" Yannhorn asked. "Is our quest over now? We have this Flame Diamond, but without Feenious, what happens next? Do we just wait for Malafar to show up now?"

"Malafar," the voice repeated. "Malafar... Feenious spoke of Malafar. He left these for you." A rumbling came from the middle of the tower. Rubble shook, and Mareak moved to get a better look. Just as the rumbling reached it peak, two packages shot out and landed on the ground before them. Yannhorn grabbed one of them and began to open it.

"I think this must be the Sphere of Eternal Will," he said feeling its shape. After removing the paper, he revealed a smooth, black sphere. "And so it is. I guess Feenious made preparations for us."

"And this is the Seed of Eternal Spring?" Darella asked rhetorically. She opened up the other package to reveal a seed.

"He left these for you," the voice said. "Perhaps you will know what to do next. For now, my purpose is complete. Farewell, Dungeon Investigators Inc." The party was silent again as the voice tuned out.

Yannhorn restarted the conversation. "So what now? Feenious was stashing these for our fight against Malafar. Do you think it was Malafar who did this? Is this our moment?"

"I guess so," Mareak replied. He looked out into the distance towards Ryden. "If Malafar is moving, I bet it's going to be on Ryden. We better get moving. I don't know how fast Malafar moves, but there's no sense in wasting time."

---

The gates of Ryden were closed when the party arrived. Outside stood a single town guard.

"Halt," the town guard called out in a whiny, voice. "Don't come near. It's not gu-gu-good in there."

Yannhorn stormed right up to the guard and put his finger up in front of him. "Okay, kid, I was killing bandits before you were born. You better open the gates for us."

"No way, sir," the guard replied as his voice cracked. "The captain says no one comes in. No one." He tried to stand tall, but he swayed back and forth in an uncertain manner.

"Calm down," Darella said. She put her hand on his shoulder and channeled some basic magic, and he instantly relaxed. "Please, tell us what's going on."

The guard took several deep breaths, then took off his helmet to see them straight. He had a messy mop of brown hair and appeared to be no more than 16.

"To be honest, I don't know. It started out as a regular morning, but shortly after midday, the sky turned dark, and I heard a crash from across town. I immediately reported to the barracks, and the captain was already dispatching everyone. There was word of demonic powers or something like that, but I couldn't really tell what was going on. All I know is that people were running scared in the streets when I made my way to my post here."

"This must be Malafar," Mareak said. "He's finally shown up to try to destroy the world, I guess, and it all starts in Ryden. Do you know where the trouble is?"

The guard shook his head. "I don't know for sure, but at least one place of interest was the Hungry Rabbit. There's something going on there. Otherwise, I imagine it's just the major landmarks."

"Fine," Mareak said. "Just open the gates for us. Trust us. We're experts." The guard looked at them still somewhat shaken, then nodded. He turned and began to pull the large wooden gate open.

As the gate swung, Darella turned to plan with the others. "I know it's a bad idea, but we have to move far here, so I think we should split up. One of us should go to the Hungry Rabbit. The biggest landmark is the Tenple of the Moon, so someone should go there. Anywhere else?"

"Someone should go to the market, too," suggested Yannhorn. "I can go to the Hungry Rabbit."

"I'll head to the Temple," Mareak said. The gate clattered open, and the guard welcomed them in.

"Then I'll go to the market," Darella finished. "Remember, the plan is to find Malafar. If you encounter him, don't engage: we need to do that together. Otherwise, remember the mission. Good luck."

---

Yannhorn ran through the empty streets of Ryden. Despite it being midday, all of the doors were closed, and curtains were drawn. He didn't even see any of the usual town guard patrolling the streets. As he neared the Hungry Rabbit, however, he heard a clamor.

Turning the corner, he saw a large crowd of guards standing outside anxiously. He recognized the captain of the guard and ran up to him.

"Captain," he called out. The captain remain fixated on the Hungry Rabbit, and it took a sharp poke to get his attention. "Captain, what's going on here?"

"Yannhorn, it's a relief to see you, if you're here to help," the captain said. "I don't know what the situation is in there, but this is where it all started. There was an explosion in a room upstairs, and the guard was called, but that was just the beginning. Since then, I have sent a handful of men in, and none of them have come out. No word of survivors, either."

"Fantastic," Yannhorn said. "Know if it's anything demonic by chance?"

"No idea," the captain replied. "We called for priests of the moon to investigate, but oddly, none of them have arrived yet, either." The captain stared into the Hungry Rabbit again but had no more to offer on the situation.

"Fine. Mind if I go in?" 

"Be my guest. I can't send any more of my men in there, even if they were willing. You're on your own."

Yannhorn nodded, took a deep breath, opened the door into the Hungry Rabbit, and walked in.

The door immediately shut behind him, and inside, the main dining room was empty. The tables were flipped, and food and drink was scattered everywhere, as though emptied in a hurry. He looked over at the counter half expecting to see Brickboard standing there as he always was, but today, the counter was deserted.

Yannhorn took his shield off of his back and pulled his sword of his sheath. He slowly walked up towards the stairs and remained vigilant for anything unexpected. The entire inn remained eerily silent, and he slowly took the stairs one at a time and paused on every step.

Reaching the top of the stairs, he looked down the hallway and saw nothing amiss. Most of the doors were closed, but at the end of the hallway, he saw a single open door and a light radiating from it. As he slowly crept up the hallway, he opened each door, but every room was empty. He knew that the final room was one of the larger, more expensive rooms intended for longer stays, but these facts seemed irrelevant in the current circumstance.

From the angle from the hallway, he could see writing all across the walls of the room, and there was flickering candle light. He took a deep breath before walking up to the doorway and looking in.

Inside, he saw a robed man floating in the air with his eyes closed and legs crossed. Instantly, the man noticed Yannhorn. He opened his eyes, unfolded his legs, stretched them to fall back to the ground, and reached out his arm to call forth a staff, which he pointed squarely at Yannhorn. Yannhorn brought his shield in front of him and peered over the top of it at the man.

"Yannhorn," the man said. Although surprised, Yannhorn didn't react to the man's familiarity with him despite not recognizing the man himself. As he studied him, he noticed how strange the man was. He was emaciated with bloodshot eyes and pale skin, but he stood with such confidence and energy. His voice was just as strong and seemed to come from everywhere at once. "You are a fool to have come here alone."

"Not the dumbest thing I have done," he replied. "Who are you, and what have you done to my favorite tavern and inn in town?"

"Who I am is unimportant," the man said. "Who I represent is everything. I am the bridge. I am Malafar's avatar." His eyes flashed red, then returned to their usual red.

"Okay, that was part one," Yannhorn said as dryly as he could. "What have you done with this place?"

"A test," the avatar replied. "This is just the beginning, and you came just in time. Enjoy the experience." His staff suddenly began to sparkle, and it shot out a beam of energy. Yannhorn ducked back behind his shield, and he felt the pulse of energy turn his shield hot. He pushed back against the force, and when he looked again, his shield was gone. Despite being warded against any magic he had encountered before, his shield had completely disintegrated to this staff.

"You have no chance," the avatar continued. "Why don't you just go run off and find your friends?"

Yannhorn began to shake, suddenly feeling naked without his shield. He held his sword out in front of him and thought through his options. Idly, he began to fish around on his body for something else to shield himself with when he stumbled across the Sphere of Eternal Will. He took it out of his pocket and held in tightly in his left hand.

"No, I don't think I will," Yannhorn said with newfound energy. "I think your reign of destruction will end by my sword. Just try me one more time, and this is over."

The avatar continued to point his staff at Yannhorn, and he laughed. "That sphere you hold. You know it does nothing, right? It's pretty and is truly a unique item of this plane, but it does nothing."

In his gut, Yannhorn felt that the avatar's words were true: for a moment, he felt a shiver as he loosened his grip on the sphere. Then, reflexively, he tossed the sphere off to the right and then gripped his sword with both hands.

"So what?" he said with as much confidence as he could. "You aren't fighting some artifact. You're fighting me, and I'm going to stop you."

The avatar grinned, and his staff began to pulse again. The sparkles appeared again, and Yannhorn dove off to his right. The beam shattered the window behind him and continued off into the distance.

Yannhorn charged at the avatar and in one clean blow, he cleaved the staff in half. The avatar recoiled and found himself holding 2 sticks. With surprising speed, he began to strike at Yannhorn with each half in a whirling pattern. Each hit of the staves burned Yannhorn, but he fought on. He shook off the pain across both of his arms and launched a vicious counter-attack on the avatar. As he gained momentum, his own strikes came faster and faster, and he found himself in a rhythm.

His warrior training took over, and he steadily drove the avatar backwards. The avatar parried with one staff and attacked with the other, but Yannhorn shrugged off the sting and burns. As he pushed the avatar back, he saw his opportunity and took one large swing.

The avatar put both of his staves up to block, but it wasn't enough and he was pushed backwards. Stunned, he reacted just in time for Yannhorn's follow-up and deliberately jumped backwards out of the open window. Yannhorn stopped his sword short and looked out the window to see the avatar flying like a bullet towards the center of town. Looking down, he saw fire rain down upon the guards. In his head, Yannhorn ran through the landmarks in that direction and realized where he needed to go.

Mareak had no difficulty locating the Temple of the Moon as he followed the giant crescent. His dash through the city was uneventful and actually very quiet. He expected there to be guards everywhere, but he saw very little action. In what seemed like no time, he arrived as the base of the white pyramid and saw the crescent directly above.

He walked the perimeter of the pyramid but didn't see any guards. The action was likely within, so he quietly sneaked into the temple to see what had transpired.

In the passages of the temple, he could hear a variety of sounds: the drip of water, the sounds of heavy breathing, the sounds of footsteps, but he didn't see anyone and didn't hear any voices. He made his way down to the Pools of Tears. Peering into the room from the entrance, he had a distinct feeling of deja vu, but he ignored it given the sight before him.

Inside were a pack of 5 hellhounds pacing back and forth standing guard on a group of priests. Twice the size of a normal dog, they had jet black fur and eyes that glowed red. Mareak thought through the possible attack strategies but had little success in determining an effective plan. With so many hellhounds in the room, he would need to disable or incapitate at least 3 of them immediately to have a chance, and that seemed impossible. Hellhounds were not only vicious, but they also breathed fire, which Mareak had little interest in.

However, Mareak knew he needed answers, so he quietly worked his way down the steps and into the room. Hiding behind pillars, he made his way closer to the hellhounds until he was only a few steps away. He counted down from 10 in his head, and on 0, he swung around the column and attacked the nearest hellhound.

Both daggers went into the hellhound's head, killing it instantly. The other hellhounds reacted and gathered to attack him. One sprung at him, which he easily sidestepped, but now in melee range, it began to claw at him. He one dagger in a reverse grip with the blade pointing backwards, and he deftly parried away the hellhound's attacks. Before he could get too comfortable, however, he suddenly felt a blast of heat from behind him. The hellhound backed off as he noticed that he was being enveloped in flames.

He turned around to look at the hellhound breathing fire upon him, but he found it in shock. Looking down at himself, he noticed that he was not burnt, and his armor and clothing were still intact. What he did feel, however, was that there was a lot of heat coming from his pocket. He tucked away a dagger and pulled the Flame Diamond out of his pocket, which shone brightly with an inner flame.

The hellhounds, realizing that their fire breath would not work, all attacked together. Mareak dodged and blocked the first few swipes, but one hellhound got a strike in. When the hellhound touched Mareak, however, the Flame Diamond dimmed, and Mareak felt a charge go through his body from his hand to the injury. By the time the hellhound had backed off, the entire scratch had healed, and Mareak felt ready as ever to fight.

With reckless abandon, Mareak stabbed back at the hellhounds. For each blow he dealt, he received 4, but the Flame Diamond continued to heal him. By the time he had defeated the last hellhound, the Flame Diamond had dimmed out, but it still retained the dancing light within.

"Thank you for your assistance," one of the priests said. They all stood in unison, shook out their white robes, then bowed to Mareak together.

"No problem," Mareak said. "Tell me what heappened here."

"They came suddenly," an older woman said in a slow and creaky voice. "We heard sounds from this room, and we rushed in to see the shimmering image of a horrible demon floating above the pool." She closed her eyes tightly in pain to think of the scene. "When it noticed us, it summoned a group of hellhounds. Some of them ran upstairs to the rest of the priest quarters, but some stayed here to capture us."

"And the demon?" Mareak asked impatiently. "What happened to him?"

"He left, I'm afraid. I don't know where he went, but what I made out of his directions to the hellhounds was that he needed an open space to execute his plan."

"Thank you," he said. "We're going to fight the demon right now: do you have anything that may help us in our effort?"

"Well, there's the Dagger of the Moon," one younger priest said.

"Shush, my brother," the older woman said. She looked back at Mareak. "Forgive him, he knows not what he speaks of."

"No, no, this is very important," Mareak said. "He wanted to lock you down and thinks your a threat. If you have a weapon I can use, I would appreciate it."

"Sadly, you cannot use it," the priest replied. "It is a most sacred treasure of our order, and its presence in our temple is key to our survival."

Mareak pulled his dagger out of his sheath again and approached the priest. "I don't have _time_ for this. I'm trying to save the world here, which includes your temple, so if you think it would at all be useful, hand it over _now_."

Frightened, the priest put her hands up. She motioned for one of the other priests to go, and when he returned, he held out a shart curved blade. Although metal, it was colored white and had symbols written all along it.

"It is said to quell the flames of abyssal creatures," she said, still frightened. "May it bring you victory."

"Indeed," Mareak replied. He snatched the dagger out of the other priest's hands and ran back out of the room and into the city again.

Darella ran through the streets of Ryden on her way to the market. Fortunately, her way was basically unimpeded as the streets were entirely vacated and doors were shuttered. Before she arrived, however, she heard a ruckus coming from a storefront. Without a second thought, she ran up to the door, and she saw that the lock had clearly been bashed in. Pulling out her club, she slowly opened the door and walked in.

Inside was a wide variety of potions and alchemy equipment. Colored liquids lined the shelves, and stands inside were cluttered with instruments, vials, and unusual reagents. From the door inward, however, there was a string of broken equipment and spilled liquids. Following the damage, it led to the counter, where she saw two wiry men menacing the shop owner with daggers.

The store owner saw Darella enter the shop. "Please, help me!" he cried out. Both of the ruffians turned to look at Darella. She continued to slowly approach them, club ready.

"Is this one of your friends?" one asked the shop owner.

"Yes, of course," the shop owner pleaded. "Please, get them out of here! They're here to loot my potions."

Darella stopped when the ruffians turned their dagger towards her. "I don't know this man, but I think both of you should leave right now, and no one will get hurt."

Without warning, the ruffians attacked. Darella brought her club up to block one dagger, and she kicked out at the other, knocking them back. They both stepped back to strategize and determine how they would overwhelm this new formidable foe. They launched forward again, and in one smooth motion. Darella slapped away both of their daggers with her club. The shop owner cheered as he peered out from beneath his counter.

"Now leave," she said firmly. The two men looked terrified, but then one of them grabbed a whistle out of his pocket and blew. Darella waited for a moment for a reaction, then heard footsteps from outside. In came another 3 ruffians, also with daggers, and they surrounded Darella.

"Yield," one of them said. "You're the one who should be leaving."

Darella looked around at her opponents. She carefully sized each of them up as they continued to wave their daggers. The first two quietly walked over to the corner where their daggers had fallen and picked them up.

Darella lowered her club. "Fine." The ruffians cleared a path between her and the door, and she started for the door.

"Wait!" the shop owner cried. "How can you not fight them? I'm sure you could take twice as many of them!"

Darella stopped but didn't turn. "Perhaps, but my role here has ended. I'm not here to protect you: my presence is an accident, and clearly fate is stacked against you now. Without the guards ever present, you have not adequately defended your shop. I will not interfere with how this situation will unfold. I believe that the universe will right itself towards balance, and perhaps in the long run, you will learn to take better precautions."

The ruffians snorted but left Darella alone as she exited. Before closing the door, she heard the shop owner whimpering.

---

"What took you so long?" Mareak asked as Darella joined him and Yannhorn at the edge of the market. 

"Just a few idiots," she replied. "How long have you been watching this?"

"Not long. Yannhorn and I just got here."

In the center of the market square stood a single figure with several dogs runninga around him. Across the square were red, glowing markings on the ground. From their angle, they couldn't determine the pattern or nature of the markings, but they pulsed with the movements of the figure. The same or a very similar fissure to the last one in the market had reappeared, and a red glow came from that as well, but no kobolds emerged. Above, the sky had turned gray.

"Any idea what's going on?" Mareak asked. "I see the hellhounds, which I ran into earlier at the Temple of the Moon."

Yannhorn narrowed his eyes. "Well, the guy in the middle is Malafar's avatar. He was doing some ritual at the Hungry Rabbit, but he fled, and I guess he's finishing up the job here."

They both looked at Darella, but she shrugged. "I have nothing to add here. Shall we step forward?" The others nodded, but before they could even take the first step, they heard a crackling noise. 

The markings hummed and slowly increased in pitch with the crackling sound. Then, the ground violent shook, throwing all three of them to the ground. Taking cover, the ground continued to quake for several seconds. Out of the corner of his eye, Mareak saw the avatar and hellhounds standing very calmly at the center of the chaos.

They stood again when the shaking had stopped, but the damage had already been done. Buildings had collapsed, and there were long cracks through the ground. They heard the cries of people in the distance.

"Okay, I think we're done with the beginning of the end," Mareak said. He pulled out the Dagger of the Moon in one hand and his trusted dagger in the other. "This is the end. Let's go."
