9. Material Difference
====================

Dungeon Investigators Inc. stood outside of the sideways tower. Yannhorn strode up tot he door confidently and ran face first into the door. He stumbled back a few steps and rubbed his nose.

"I wonder why it didn't greet us this time," he said, thinking aloud. He approached the door again and gave it 3 solid knocks. "I really hope that Feenious is home."

"I guess the worst case is that we can visit the Hungry Rabbit and try to find a quest there," said Darella.

"Not the worst idea," said Mareak. "I could use some bonus cash on the side. Unfortunately, I didn't factor in the travel time into our anticipated hourly rate for this trip. I may demand more from Feenious."

"Yes! Feenious is here!," they suddenly heard. They looked around for the source, and Mareak was the first one to find it. He pointed toward the tip of the tower off to their right, where they saw Feenious waving out of the window, also sideways.

"I'll be right down!" Feenious cried at them. He retreated back from the window. Despite the distance, the party could hear gurgling water, metallic crashes, breaking glass, chicken clucking, falling books, and snapping wood coming down the length of the tower. The sound continued as it hit the right angle in the tower and came down the vertical floors. Just as the sound reached the doorway in front of them, the door flew open, and they saw Feenious standing there, perfectly composed.

"Welcome in! Forgive the mess: I'm doing some renovations, hence the broken deadly security system," he said with a big grin on his face. The party muttered thanks and nodded as they walked into the tower. Inside the reception area was the biggest surprise: the room was clean.

"Wow, I love what you have done with the place," said Darella. "These wooden chairs look much more sanitary than the old couches you had."

"Without the dust and books strewn everywhere, I feel like I might be in a respectable library," said Yannhorn. He walked over to the single bookshelf, which held some of presumably the most important volumes. He scanned the titles, felt the cleanliness of the shelves with his index finger, and walked away satisfied.

"Now, please tell me you have found this artifact," Feenious said. He stood in the middle of the room, constantly twisting to look at all of three of them as usually.

"Never change," Darella said as she reached into her pocket. She fished out the Seed and tossed it to Feenious who caught it with both hands as a basket. "This is the Seed of Eternal Spring. It apparently has helped the dryads there to grow strong and plentiful and fluorish altogether."

"Wondeful," he said. "I guess this explains the quote about it being the 'seed of life.'"

Mareak blinked rapidly and focused again on Feenious. "Wait, did you just say that you knew it was a Seed? Why didn't you tell us that? You know, the quest was actually quite hard without that information, and you owe us bonus for that."

Feenious laughed quietly then shrugged. "I thought it was metaphorical. But no matter. Yes, this treasure is certainly worth the finder's fee. And some bonus." He snapped his fingers, and gold pieces appeared in mid-air and fell onto a small cauldron in the middle of the room. The party all sprang forward to grab their share.

"I will keep this safe while you continue your adventure," Feenioius continued. "Darella, did you have a chance to inspect the seed at all?"

"No, I didn't," she said. She closed her coin purse and stood to face Feenious. "The past few days between resting at the Burned Skillet and arriving on your doortep just flew by."

"Well, I will conduct my own experiments upon it. As you might expect, however, I believe the seed brings one into greater touch with natural energy, unlike that horrific Ruby of Eternal Light. I imagine it may amplify your druidic powers, but that remains to be seen."

"Speaking of which," Yannhorn jumped in, "what's our next move? Malafar presumably is powering up right now, and you said we needed _items_, plural, to be able to defeat him. Have you found anymore in the area?"

"Indeed I have," Feenious replied, twisting a few hairs in his beard. "I assure you that this will be your most exotic setting yet."

"I find that hard to believe," said Mareak. "We have fought pirates on the high seas, explored faraway ziggurats, and even escaped a jungle where trees grew upside down. But of course," he added, "if it is that exotic, we should be compensated extra."

"What about another plane?" Feenious said. He drew a wand out of a pocket in the folds of his robe and drew a large circle with the tip in the air. The area inside of the circle appeared to warp and wobble, then swirl, and instead of looking through to the other side, they saw an image into another world.

The party all came close to look at the projection in mid-air. Inside, they saw a brilliant pink and purple, translucent landscape. Instead of grass or rock, the ground had a ribbony, billowing look.

"Mareak, I think this might have pirates beat," said Yannhorn. "Feenious, I thought you said that we were looking for items of the material plane. Why do we have to go somewhere else for it?"

"Well, you like to collect souvenirs of places you have been, yes? Well, an inhabitant of this plane happened to find a treasure of the material plane they did not want to leave behind. And you must take it from him. Look, there he is!" The party turned to look at the projection, and within, they saw a large, bulbous, green creature with fairies flying all about it. It shuffled along on two disproportionately small legs, and its 4 arms waved about in circles. The details on its head were hard to see, but it was only vaguely humanoid.

"He doesn't look too tough," said Yannhorn. "We just need to get in there, bully him around, and get out."

"Looks can be deceiving," Feenious replied, sounding far wiser than usual. "This plane does not obey the same laws as our own, and you might find it quite a challenge. Even so, we can go as soon as you're ready." Feenious poked his wand into the middle of the projection, and the image collapsed in upon the point. The party looked at each other for confirmation, then all began nodding in agreement. "Alright, this way. And don't touch anything on the way.

Feenious stepped past the party and towards a nearby wall. As he approached, the stones of the wall slid to form a staircase, which he began ascending.

"You know, I never thought about how he gets down here," Darella said. "He usually just appears and starts talking." She followed close behind. The staircase continued to form itself in a spiral around the walls of the tower as Feenious ascended. When they neared the top, they saw a doorway in the side of the tower, which Feenious pushed open.

"Mind the gap," he said as he stepped through.

"I don't see any gap," said Darella. As she stepped in, she felt the floor fall out from beneath her. The world rushed by her as her body fell forward. She reached out with her hands to break her fall.

And found herself standing upright with her arms extended, like Frankenstein, in the middle of an alchemy lab. Still disoriented, she stumbled forward a few steps and stopped herself just short of a table of beakers and test tubes.

"Don't touch!" Feenious said. Darella quickly brought her arms back close to her body. Yannhorn and Mareak similarly stumbled out of the doorway and reoriented themselves to the room. Feenious waved them onward, and they followed him up a stairwell. They ascended several more floors filled with a random assortment of magical, scientific, and baffling sights. Soon, Feenious stepped into a room where only a single object sat in the middle covered with a white sheet.

When all three of the party entered the room, Feenious walked over to the sheet and in one dramatic motion, he pulled the sheet off to reveal a wooden chair.

"Uh, did we come all this way to help you setup for a dinner party?" asked Yannhorn.

"No, no, sit! It's a magical, planeshifting chair!" He tossed the sheet to the side and held both hands out towards the chair.

"Feenious, there's one chair," Mareak said. "And there are three of us."

Feenious's excited smile turned to skeptical and thoughful face. "Hmm, I hadn't considered that when designing it. Well, it takes a lot of energy to run it multiple times, so you'll all need to sit together. In each other's laps." The party stared at Feenious and quickly determined that he was not joking.

"Well, Darella, you're the biggest of us, so you first." Darella rolled her eyes and sat in the chair. Next, Mareak fitted his elven frame in Darella's lap, and then the halfling Yannhorn hopped up last.

"Now, don't move," said Feenious. He began to wave his hands around in the air and chanted a magical spell.

"Wait, how do we get back?" cried Mareak. Feenious looked at him to indicate that he had heard the question, but he continued to chanting. The three felt their bodies turn light, and when they looked down at their bodies, they saw themselves slightly transparent. Tingling filled their bodies, and their vision started to fog up, half filled with the tower room and half purple-pink.

The chanting stopped, and they heard Feenious say, "When you find the item, you should have a strong connection to the material plane, and you will figure it out. Enjoy!" And with that, the room flashed out, and they were in a another plane.
