16. Preparation and Reflection
==============================

"Thanks for showing up all on time," Carl said when he saw all three of his players standing on his doorstep together. They all squeezed in through the door and quickly took their shoes off.

"No problem," Wayne said. "I think we all agreed with your email that school is a little too busy for us to spend too much time dawdling right now."

"So I guess we can catch up on life relatively quickly," Carl said as they walked up the stairs together. "Around the horn: what's new with your Lindsay?"

"Nothing surprising," she said happily. "I'm feeling pretty good about all of my AP tests this year, so I'll just knock them down in order."

"How many are you taking?"

"Six."

"Unbelievable," Carl replied. They came to the top of the stairs and all immediately moved to the table, where they began to shuffle through the papers and setup their miniatures on the board. "And nationals for math? Hopefully you're keeping your work for that going strong?"

"Team looks good. I think we have been doing a lot better since we relaxed and decided that we should have some fun along the way, too."

"Cool. And you, Drew?"

"Same," Drew replied. He pulled his character sheet out of the pile and moved towards the fridge. "Lots of APs, but not as many as Lindsay. I'm still spending a lot of time with Jimmy and Mario."

"Think they have a shot at winnning this year?"

"Definitely," Drew said confidently. He smiled. "Not to overplay my hand, but they have gotten some seriously awesome practice over the past few months, and I think they look really solid."

"Great. And finally," Carl said doing a drumroll with his fingers on the table. "Wayne, any news on college decisions?"

Wayne shook his head. "I'm still talking a lot with my family and friends about it. You know, I just went in to talk to my counselor, and she had a lot of advice for me, but I'm still up in the air on this one. I'll let you know next month."

"Sounds good." Carl flipped open his laptop and checked the table. "I think we're good to go. Anyone have anything else?" Lindsay raised her hand, and the others chuckled. "Yes, Lindsay?"

Lindsay put her hand down. "How are you doing? I heard you're all set to go to UT." Carl nodded. "Congrats on that, not like it was a surprise. More importantly, though, what's your plan for prom?"

"Thanks about the college part," he first said, then paused. "And thanks for asking about prom, too. I'm going with Mickey."

Lindsay didn't immediately react. "Wait, who's Mickey?"

"His stand partner," Carl explained.

Lindsay's eyes opened wide in realization. "Oh, I got it. Well, congrats. Going as friends?"

"Yeah, I figured it was better that way," Carl said. "I'm still reeling a little bit, so I went with a safe choice: there are no expectations, and we can just go and have fun." Linsday nodded her approval but said nothing more. "Are we ready to start, then?"

"Okay, one more thing," Linsday said. "Can we talk about what happened at the end of the last session? Wayne, how could you leave Wen's agents behind?"

Wayne shrugged. "It wasn't worth the effort. We were clearly outmatched by the guards, and the head honcho knew exactly where we were to call in more help. There was a boss fight I didn't want to take."

"But we didn't even try!"

"Yeah, that was pretty surprising," Carl added. "I spent a non-trivial amount of time trying to figure out stats and abilities for Kang, and we didn't get to use any of them."

Wayne frowned. "I thought that was the lesson here. Prisoner guy said to cut your losses and think about the long game. Well in this case, the long game is to make sure the world doesn't get blown up by some demon, some random agents included. We succeeded in our task, and there were casualities along the way. Besides, it was the right thing for Mareak to do as a character."

"I agree," Drew said nodding. "Yannhorn, if he had the balls for it, probably wouldn't have run, but Mareak would definitely run in a situation like that. And it was probably the right call with a busted hand."

Lindsay sighed. "Yeah, I guess it makes sense. I'm still not happy about it, but I guess this is what teamwork is like."

"Indeed," Carl said with some finality. "Should we get started with the session again?" Everyone nodded. "Cool. So you all are just getting back to the sideways tower when you see it in ruins. Let's start there."
