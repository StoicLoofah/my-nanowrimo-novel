4. Decisions
====================

"Hey guys, sorry about that," said Carl as he walked back into the game room. He waved at the three players who had settled in while he was in his bedroom. "I thought I could talk to Marie real quick before starting, but I guess she had more to say than I thought."

"Ride on. We were just catching up," said Wayne as he put away his phone and sat up on the couch. "How are things going with Marie? I hope she's liking college and not missing you too much."

"Nah, she loves it. She was just telling me about the pep rally they had earlier this week. I didn't know she was so into football, or at least, she wasn't while she was here in high school. I'm just glad she finds time to call me between her studying and all of the rest of college life."

"I'm guessing you guys have talked about how you don't plan on going to A&M," said Wayne.

Carl shrugged in his University of Texas hoodie. "More or less. I think we have a good understanding of the situation." Carl almost continued but decided not to speak. He picked up his glass and took a long sip before changing subjects. "Drew, how are things going with you?"

"Good," Drew replied, nodding slowly. "I have my partner set for this upcoming debate tournament, so we're pretty much unstoppable at this point. Otherwise, my mind is on Mareak counting up his most recent haul from the market."

"Yeah, we'll get to that in a minute," added Wayne. "But before that, I want to know, Lindsay, what your plan for Homecoming is."

Lindsay looked embarassed as the three others looked at her anxiously. "Okay, it's totally not fair for 3 guys to be ambushing me on this one. But if you're interested, Rick did ask me to go."

Wayne hooted a bit, then laughed. "I'm so proud of you," he said with mock affection.

Lindsay sent a fake glare back at him. "I'm offended that you would ever believe otherwise. Nerds ask nerds," she explained, which resulted in more laughter. "He did it by making a bouquet of flowers using polar graphs on a bunch of graphing calculators." When she received blank stares, she shook her head. "It's a math thing."

"So did you say yes?" asked Drew. 

"Well, not yet," she replied. Wayne sighed, and Drew clutched at his chest, then threw his arms wide and sunk back into the couch limp. "I told you that there's a regional meet that day."

"Wait, _a_ regional meet?" checked Wayne.

"Yes, _a_ regional meet. There are 2 of them."

"So just go to the other one!" exclaimed Wayne. "You have already skipped 50% of the high school homecomings in your life. You better get on it soon, or it'll be like you never even went to high school."

"First, there's obviously so much more to high school than that," Lindsay retorted. "Second, the next regionals is in December. I have to take the PSAT in-between then, and who knows: I could fail to qualify in that one, so I should go to both of them."

"You're not going to fail to make it," said Carl. "I remember Mrs. Brown said that you got the highest score by far last year. You're going to qualify. Lighten up."

Lindsay had a look of disbelief for a moment. "Wayne, you have to understand. What if you had 2 chances to get through districts for cross country. Would you just skip one of them for a dance?"

"Uh, yeah, I would. If it was _homecoming_ and somebody wanted to go with me. Lindsay, there's a lot more to high school than just math competitions."

"That's easy for you to say: you have your college scholarships for cross country." Her delivery came off as an accusation. Carl and Drew looked wide-eyed as their eyes jumped back and forth between the two to see how they would react. Lindsay blinked and relaxed. "Sorry, that came off harsh. Can we just play?"

"No problem, no offense taken," said Wayne as he waved his hand dismissively. "I'm just trying to give you some perspective as someone with more high school behind than ahead. But yeah, let's play." Wayne reached out and grabbed his character sheet from the table. "We just rescued the priests and saved that pool thing, right?"

"Definitely not," said Carl, recognizing the attempted inception. "The pool turned to some sort of acid because you guys were too anxious to fight kobolds and didn't bother to check what the others were doing when you got in close."

"Hey man, I did my job," said Drew with his hands up in the air. "Yannhorn uses his sword, not eyes."

"Fair. I guess by that logic, running isn't really your job either," said Carl as he skimmed notes from the last game.

"Whatever. I blame your crappy, rigged dice. I didn't fall in the portal in any case," said Drew. "What was inside of that portal, anyways if I had fallen in."

"A secret," replied Carl with a grin. "But anyways, you guys are resting at the inn right now."

"The, uh, Anxious Rabbit?" guessed Drew.

"Yes, the _Hungry_ Rabbit," corrected Carl. "Run by..."

"Brickbeard," added Lindsay.

"No, Brickboard." Carl rolled his eyes. " I swear, I don't even know why I bother with all of this lore and coming up with names. It's not like you guys know who I'm talking about anyways.

"Okay, so you guys have a great night of sleep and wake up in the morning well-rested and still in possession of all of your possessions. Remember, Feenious asked you to return today. What do you guys do?"
