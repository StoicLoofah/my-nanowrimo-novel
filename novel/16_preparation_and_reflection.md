16. Preparation and Reflection
==============================

"Okay, can we talk about what happened at the end of the last session?" Lindsay asked. "Wayne, how could you leave Wen's agents behind?"

Wayne shrugged. "It wasn't worth the effort. We were clearly outmatched by the guards, and the head honcho knew exactly where we were to call in more help. There was a boss fight I didn't want to take."

"But we didn't even try!"

"Yeah, that was pretty surprising," Carl added. "I spent a non-trivial amount of time trying to figure out stats and abilities for Kang, and we didn't get to use any of them."

Wayne frowned. "I thought that was the lesson here. Prisoner guy said to cut your losses and think about the long game. Well in this case, the long game is to make sure the world doesn't get blown up by some demon, some random agents included. We succeeded in our task, and there were casualities along the way. Besides, it was the right thing for Mareak to do as a character."

"I agree," Drew said nodding. "Yannhorn, if he had the balls for it, probably wouldn't have run, but Mareak would definitely run in a situation like that. And it was probably the right call with a busted hand."

Lindsay sighed. "Yeah, I guess it makes sense. I'm still not happy about it, but I guess this is what teamwork is like."

"Indeed," Carl said with some finality. "Should we get started with the session again?" Everyone nodded. "Cool. So you all are just getting back to the sideways tower when you see it in ruins. Let's start there."
