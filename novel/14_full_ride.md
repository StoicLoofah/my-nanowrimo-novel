14. Full Ride
===================

Drew knocked on the door to Carl's house. Carl usually answered quickly, but this time, there was no immediate response. He knocked again, and Carl's mom opened the door.

"Oh hi, Drew," she said with a big smile. "You know, they're actually playing out back on the patio, so you can just walk around the side gate if you like."

"Sure thing. Thanks again for hosting us every week."

"No problem! Hope you have fun," she said as she closed the door.

Drew walked back out into the warm late afternoon sun. He walked straight across the lawn, around the side gate, and emerged from the alley onto the patio, where the rest of the players were sipping lemonade around the table.

"Hey everyone," Drew said. "What brings us outside today? I don't think sunlight and nerds mix well."

"Just getting a head start on spring break," Carl replied. He poured another glass of lemonade and handed it to Drew over the glass table. "You know that pleasant weather is such a narrow window around here that this might literally be the one day a year that we meet and don't have to hide from the hot or cold."

"Good point," Drew said. Drew reached into the middle of the table, picked up a pile of papers, and began to rifle through them. "Anyways, what's new with the rest of you?"

Lindsay and Carl both looked at Wayne with smiles on their faces. He looked at each of them, then shrugged.

"I guess I'll go first," Wayne started. He set up straight in his chair and looked straight at Drew. "I got a full ride to Texas for cross country."

Drew immediately smiled and dropped the pile of papers in his hand. "Wow, congratulations! That's got to be huge for you. I'm glad that all of your training paid off." Drew offered a high five across the table, which Wayne accepted. "So you're going, yes?"

"Well, maybe, maybe not."

"Wait, what?", Lindsay exclaimed. "It's a full ride! How can you not go? Wasn't it at the top of your list?"

"Okay, calm down, Lindsay," Wayne said soothingly. "I'm not sure what's going to happen, but for right now, there are a lot of factors to consider. The biggest one is that Austin is quite far from here, and my family might still need me around here. My mom still hasn't fully recovered."

Lindsay frowned. Before either Drew or Carl could jump in, she began again. "Not to be callous, but you can't miss this. There isn't a better school in the state, and if you're going stay local, it's going to be a community college."

"Which isn't the worst thing," Wayne responded defensively.

"Not the worst, but I know you already have taken care of a lot of basic college credit anyways," Lindsay said. "It would basically be a huge waste of time for you. Think of the opportunities at Texas, though!"

Wayne shook his head. "I totally get it, but really, the most important thing is what happens with my family, and I still need to see how that shakes out. Maybe it totally does work out for me to leave, but right now, it's not clear."

"You can take the long view on this one, too," Carl said. "I'm sure your family wants the best for you too, and an education and the opportunities for going to a 4-year college are way better than if you just took more classes here in town."

"I hear you," Wayne said immediatelyâ€“so fast that Carl frowned in skepticism that he was truly heard. "Still, this took a really negative turn. Despite what the final choice is, I'm happy now that I have the scholarship. Carl, I might join you in Austin this fall." Carl just pointed at the Longhorn shirt he had on and nodde din agreement. "I already heard from the others: what's new with you, Drew?"

"Uh, not much," Drew replied. He took a moment to gather his thoughts after switching topics. "Debate continues to be very busy, so the usual."

"I thought there wasn't much for you to do at this point," Wayne said. "Aren't you already out of the running?"

"Well, I'm out, but I'm really trying to help Jimmy and Mario prep. We're trying out some new practice techniques, and I'm the best competition they have in the school, so I pitch in as much as I can."

"Good for you, Drew," Carl said ernestly. "You know, I was really worried about where you were a few months ago, but I think you have really bounced back and made the best of the circumstance."

"Thanks," Drew replied. "You know, I was pretty worried about you too after the last session. How are you holding up?"

Carl tapped his fingers on the top of his closed laptop a few times. "I'm holding up fine. Yeah, sorry for the rough session last time. I definitely wasn't in the right mindset to play, but as the DM, I figure that it's most important that I have a good showing for the game and keep things moving. But I am feeling better now."

"Have you talked to Marie?", Wayne asked.

"Yes." Carl didn't continue, but everyone else continued to look at him. After a few seconds, Carl let out an awkward laugh. "Sorry, I wasn't planning on sharing more. We're okay. Let's just leave it at that."

"Yeah, no problem," Drew said. "And just to finish going around the horn, what's new with you, Lindsay? Katie told me that you made it to her dance recital. Good on you for finding time for that."

Linsday perked up at the mention of the dance recital. "Yeah! I really enjoyed it. I think it meant a lot to Katie to have at least one friend come to see her perform, and I was glad to be that one person. But other than that, it's just numbers all of the time for me."

"And letters in algebra," Drew added with a smirk.

"And that," Lindsay said. "Shall we get started with the game?"

"What an excellent suggestion," Carl said. He opened his laptop and began typing. "Okay, so right now, you're in Kang's prison. Sort of. Do you remember the details of the plan you came up with to work with Wen?"

"Heck yes," Wayne exclaimed. "I take a lot of pride in that sort of thing, though I know that working it out with you is the best way to ensure that conditions change enough for the entire plan to be invalid." Carl laughed unsympathetically.

"Was there enough time for me to meditate and memorize new spells?", Lindsay asked. "Remember, I didn't expend most of my slots."

Carl squinted at his laptop screen and scrolled through a few pages. "Yeah, that should be fine. Swap out whatever you want right now." Lindsay began to erase data on her character sheet.

"And what's the situation with my hand?", Wayne asked.

"Still numb. Probably will be until the end of the adventure. Same penalty applies, and try to play through it. Any other questions?" Carl looked back and forth across everyone several times, then nodded. "Sounds good. Let's start."
