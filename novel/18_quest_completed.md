18. Quest Completed
=====================

"This is it," Carl said with a big grin. He pointed to his laptop screen. "I have the whole scene planned out here. Today, you win or lose." He paused, then backtracked. "I hope you guys win."

"Me, too!" Lindsay exclaimed. Carl, Drew, Lindsay, and Wayne all sat around the table, beverages in hand, leaning in for the quest ahead. "I'm so excited for the end. Good job timing this with the end of school, by the way. You know, I really want to know how this ends, but I'm also really sad to think that this is it."

Drew nodded his head. "Well, three years of roleplaying is a long time. Cheers." He held up his glass of water, and the others leaned in clinked their cans of soda and cups of milk.

"It's not over-over," Carl said. "We can still play over the summer: it probably will just be minor stuff to kind of keep us going until Wayne and I leave for college. Hook 'em!"

Wayne smiled and made the horns hand signal back.

"Congratulations," Lindsay said to Wayne. "I'm glad you decided to go. What made up your mind?"

"Basically my family," Wayne conceded. "I wanted to be here for them, but I had some long talks, and eventually, my sisters convinced me that they would be okay, and that I should do my own thing."

"Go Hannah!" Drew said, and the others laughed. "Do you know what you'll be studying yet?"

"I applied for engineering and got in, but who knows," Wayne said. "Things change, and I'm sure there will be great opportunities out there. And you? You're ready to cruise into senior year?"

"Almost," Drew replied. "Nationals still isn't for a couple weeks, but things keep looking better and better for Jimmy and Mario." Drew smiled again and relaxed back into his seat. "I'm feeling pretty good about next year, though. I think Christie and I are really pushing them, so we should be in contention for next year."

"Speaking of nationals," Linsday jumped in, "you guys will be glad to know that our math team is right on track as well. I too will report in later."

"More importantly, though," Drew countered, "Lindsay apparently has been cutting out of after school practice a little early." Lindsay bit her lip. "Mind telling the others where you have been going?" Wayne and Carl looked at Lindsay with great anticipation.

"Well," she started, "I have been seeing Rick a few times in the evening." Carl hooted and held out his hand for a high five. Lindsay lightly accepted it, then found herself embraced in a big hug from Wayne. "But," she managed to get out, "the team is doing well anyways, so I don't think that the lost time should affect our performance."

"Whatever," Drew said, very satisfied with having brought it up. "We're just happy for you."

"Thanks you guys," Lindsay said ernestly. Everyone returned to their seats. "But that's not important right now. All you guys want to do is here the gossip, but I'm here to play. Can we kick some butt and chat afterwards?"

"No problem," Carl said. "Everyone ready?" Drew and Wayne nodded. "Let's go."
