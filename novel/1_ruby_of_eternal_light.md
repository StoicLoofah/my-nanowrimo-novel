"I can't find any traps." Mareak stood up, and his face reappeared in the flickering light before the door. He wiped some dust off of his fingers as he walked back to his 2 fellow adventurers. "It doesn't help that you lost my kit of thieves' tools earlier, but hey: you're going through first anyways, so I'm sure the gods will be just."

"I told you already: I didn't lose them. I thought the gnome was very trustworthy, and he will bring them back." Yennhorn leaned his short sword against the stone wall and cast his torch forward again. He carefully stepped up to the door, listened for a moment, then slammed his body against it. The wood popped, and the door crumpled open. "It's just another empty room." He walked back, picked up his short sword, then stepped through into the next chamber.

"How is there nothing of interest? We have been down here for 2 days," said Darella. A druid of the forest, Darella was the least comfortable of the three to be crawling through dungeons. "I'll look around and see if I can find anything useful."

There was yet another door forward, opposite the one they had entered from, but the hallway was just as likely to have more enemies ahead. Yennhorn already stood close to the door, listning for any sound for guidance. Darella walked slowly along the perimeter of the room, looking for any hints of what else may be around. Although she found little interest in masonry, a patch of moss or the occasional vermin could tell her much about the design of the dungeon. As she passed her fingers along the wall, she felt a slight breeze coming seemingly from the stones itself. It smelled fresh, which was a refreshing change.

"Guys, get over here," she said, not bothering to gesture. She pushed herself closer to the wall.

Mareak swiftly crossed the room, providing his own torch for additional light. His elven eyes crossed over the wall several times, then stopped. "I think there's a secret door here." Darella stepped back, and she followed Mareak's finger as he motioned the outline of the door with his index finger. "Yennhorn, can your body smash down a stone wall too? I think our treasure is near. There are markings in the masonry that read something ancient."

"Yeah, I bet that the dwarves left a giant 'Treasure here' sign in script. Let me take a look," responded Yennhorn. Although somewhat worn, the script was clearly in ancient Dwarven, and though Dwarven was not typically part of a Halfling's education, he was always exceptionally smart.

"It says, 'Peril for those ahead'." He spoke slowly as he worked over the script. "'Do not take the source of life from us, and you will find friends. The path will be clear when it is least.'" Yennhorn turned to the others. "What does that mean?"

"I don't know. I'm not the genius of the death pits," Mareak responded.

"Look, that was a great idea. I'm sorry it didn't quite work out for your hamster," Yennhorn shot back. Their conversation quickly devolved as Darella stood in silence, thinking and thinking. She then closed her eyes, then raised her hands. As she lowered her hands again, their torches started to flicker out. The other two noticed and broke their bickering.

"Not cool. We are running low on torches, and we lose stuff in the dark." Yennhorn sighed as they stood in the dark, waiting.

Suddenly, the wall before them began to glow a dark red. Darella opened her eyes and looked at the other two without the slightest bit of annoyance. The red light illuminated their faces as the stone changed shape. The rough parts of the stone changed to leaves, and soon, the entire door appeared to be no more than a hedge, which subsequently retreated away to reveal a new chamber. 

They heard the rush of water and could make out the outline of more plants, but most importantly, on a dais in the center of the room lay a bright jewel: the Ruby of Eternal Light.


As the party walked into the room, they were seemingly transported to a completely different realm. Instead of the occasional drop of water, there were small waterfalls all around them. Their feet kicked up the soft dirt, and their body brushed past the ferns. The room wasn't bright, but the ruby and their torches provided enough light to see the ceiling disappear into clouds several feet above their heads.

"I think we took a wrong turn," said Yannhorn. Despite the serenity of the room, he held his sword and torch up and ready as though to fight off each branch.

"Relax. This is nature as true as it can exist. The Ruby provides the light, energy, and warmth as described by the wizard, and even the smallest life can fluorish in its presence." Darella stopped and took a deep breath in, then exhaled. "Don't you feel alive here? There truly is balance here."

"I couldn't care less about what it does. I care that the wizard cares what it's worth," said Mareak. He stepped ahead of the rest of them up and onto the dais and stood in front of the Ruby of Eternal Light floating at chest height. He knelt down to look at it at eye level and focused intensely on it. "Let's just take it and go. Do you think there are any wards on it? If only we had a wizard with us."

All three were silent for a moment after this comment.

Mareak broke the silence first. "Look, we'll just have to take a chance. I'll just throw a bag over it, and we'll head out." He turned to rifle through his backpack for an appropriate way to take it.

As Mareak moved about, Yannhorn noticed something move behind him, but when he turned, he could only see the plants. As Mareak's body threw different shadows around the room, however, the plants continued to shift, in an almost threatening manner.

"If you're going to grab it, just grab it," said Yannhorn. "This place is giving me the heebie jeebies." As he spoke, the room suddenly darkened as Mareak covered the Ruby. The Ruby and bag fell to the ground as the magical field dispersed. The dull thud was quickly followed by a grunt, then another thud. Mareak turned to see Yannhorn's torch fall to the ground. "This is your fault!" Yannhorn cried from the darkness.

Darella and Mareak heard a series of thwacks come from the darkness. Darella reacted first and grabbed the club off of her back and ran forward. Holding up her torch, she saw vines whipping forward and back and Yannhorn amidst it with his short sword in hand. Seeing this, she dropped her club and began to fumble around inside of a pouch for something.

Mareak looked at Yannhorn, then back down at the Ruby. Despite it being covered, he could still see a faint glow from inside the bag. He quickly came to his senses, however, grabbed and stuffed it in his pack, then ran forward to help out. Forgetting the dais, however, he stumbled when he missed the step down and fell flat against the dirt floor. Before he could push himself up, he felt a giant weight on his back. A massive leaf had seemingly flung itself onto him and was pinning him against the ground.

Darella could hear Mareak's cries for help, but she kept her eyes down until she felt a squishy, wet sphere in her pouch. Something flew by and cut across her left thigh, but she remained focused. Crushing the sphere into her palm, she began to chant and threw the guts of a crocodile eye into the air.

When she finished, a rush of air blew outwards from Darella and swept across the room. The vines and leaves recoiled back towards their previously static positions, except for the cut bits lying around Yannhorn. He sat up somewhat dazed, then put on a mock tough face. "I was fine, thank you. I was looking forward to the experience."

"Well, you might still get a chance." Darella picked up her club and looked up again. "The spell will only last for a moment. I suggest we get out of here right now lest those plants come after the light of their lives."

All three quickly checked their gear, then moved towards the exit. Fortunately, the gap remained.

"I'll be glad to get back to the dungeon," remarked Yannhorn. As they crossed the threshold, however, they noticed much more light encircling them. More importantly, they noticed the orcs holding the light encircling them.

"You take shiny," said a voice near the middle. A slightly better armed but otherwise normally greenish orc stepped forward. "Now we take shiny, and you stay. And no leave. Ever."

Yannhorn sighed.


"Look, I'm sure we can work out a deal here," suggested Mareak. He held his torch high above his head in his left hand in a gesture of peace, and he held his right hand open and forward. "I'm sure you also are on a contract to get the Ruby, but to be frank, we have no idea where it is either." 

"No deal. You lie. You give it now." The head orc looked as resolute as ever about it. Darella shifted uneasily and thought to say something, but closed her mouth as soon as she opened it. It was best to leave the talking to the best bluffer amongst them.

Mareak laughed. "Well, that's no way to talk amongst friends. I haven't accused you of being anything. Now, what makes you think that we have the Ruby?" 

One of the orcs snorted. The head orc pointed with his jagged, rusted sword at Mareak's pack. Mareak looked back and saw a faint red glow coming from a corner of his bag.

"Ah. Yes. That." As he talked, he turned back and forth to address all of the orcs. All 8, by his count. "That's not the Ruby. It's simply a toy for my daughter. Let me show you." As he reached around his body towards his back, he suddenly dropped the torch and grabbed a dagger hidden at his waist. In one smooth motion, he whipped it back across his body and flung it at the head orc.

It hit the orc standing next to the head orc square in the chest: the only where he wore armor. Rage filled the orc's face, and all of the orcs raced forward.

"Really good," Yannhorn shouted and he dropped his torch to pull his shield off of his back. Mareak and Darella dropped behind Yannhorn and pulled their weapons into ready position just in time to parry the first set of blows from the orcs.

The melee picked up quickly as weapons bounced back and forth. They exchanged minor blows, and though the adventurers held back most of the attack, they were sinking backwards towards opening they had just left. 

"We're not going back in there," cried Yannhorn. "I am not doing that, that living room again." The other two laughed while striking back at the orcs. 

Then, Darella's eyes widened with an idea. "Maybe you won't, but I will." She turned and dashed into the room as the orcs swung wide where she was. Mareak almost turned to curse her, but was cut off by a wild swing at his arm.

Thirty seconds passed as the other two remained hard-pressed to avoid injury, hoping that Darella had some brilliant idea. Then, vines shot out of the room and past their arms. Mareak almost screamed, but when he turned to deflect the next blow, he saw the orc before him being restrained by vines.

Darella came running out of the opening, hopping over a vine and past the melee towards the closed door forward. "Quickly!" she yelled. Mareak and Yennhorn looked at each other, then ran to follow after dealing parting gifts with their weapons to the restrained orcs.

"Okay, explanation required. What happened, and where are we going?" Mareak chased after Darella who had swung open the next door without consideration for what was behind it and ran in.

"One, druid magic way above your very short head. Two, I'm sure they have friends behind us. The only way is down."
