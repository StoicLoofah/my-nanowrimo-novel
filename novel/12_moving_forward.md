12. Moving Forward
=========================

Everyone sat in silence around the table. Wayne was texting on his phone and wholly engaged elsewhere. Carl sat in his recliner, arms folded, and stared at the game board. Drew nibbled on a pretzel. And Lindsay rocked back and forth in her seat, glancing at the others in succession and back around again.

Carl's mom had let Lindsay in, and when she walked upstairs, she only got a few grunts of welcomes. Being the last one to arrive, she sat down quietly and waited for the conversation to pick up where it had left off, but no one had spoken in the 5 minutes since she arrived.

"So, I went to Sadie this year," she began. There was no reaction from anyone.

"I hope you guys are proud of me for having asked someone and found time to go," she continued. The only response was tapping of keys on the phone and crunch of pretzels.

"Hopefully you guys had good Valentine's too?", she asked hopefully. Carl slumped forward and put his head in his hands.

"Now you did it," Drew said. He grabbed his cup of water and took a long sip. Wayne put his phone face down on the seat next to him. and grimaced at Lindsay.

Lindsay leaned over to Drew and whispered, "Did what? What's new?"

"Carl. Marie," he whispered back and shook his head.

Lindsay's eyes widened in shock, then immediately returned to a normal state. She scratched her head. "What happened?", she whispered back.

"What happened," Carl said loudly with his head still down, "was that I was planning to go visit her at college for Valentine's Day, and the night before while I'm packing, we video chat, and she broke up with me."

"Wow, that's really rough. Tough luck, man," said Wayne as he reached over to pat Carl on the back. "Look, we don't have to play today if you don't want to."

"Agreed," Lindsay quickly added. "I don't know if you just want to talk about it, or if you want us to go, but there's no pressure from us."

"No, it's okay," Carl said. He lifted his head up and fell backwards into his seat, which pushed it backwards into a recliner position. Carl stared up at the ceiling. "This game is one of the few things in life that I feel like I can control right now, so it's a comfort. Besides, we don't have that many sessions left before we have to split, and there'a grand finale coming up."

"To be honest, you don't actually sound that excited about that right now," Drew replied. Carl rolled his head to the side to stare at Drew. Drew recoiled and put his hands up. "My bad. But seriously, did you want to talk about it?"

"What's to talk about?", Carl asked. He pushed himself back to a sitting position.

"Apparently a lot," Lindsay said. "Being an entirely impartial judge of relationships, people only say stuff like that when they have too _much_ to talk about. Have you talked to her since the breakup?"

"No."

"Okay. When she broke up with you, did she tell you why?"

"She said that she felt 'trapped', whatever that means." Drew coughed on his pretzel, waved off the attention, then gestured for Lindsay to continue.

"Did she give you any examples?", Lindsay asked.

"No." Lindsay looked nervously at Drew and Wayne for next steps. Drew shook his head, but Wayne jumped.

"Well, what was the last thing that she reacted badly to?", Wayne asked. "Did you talk about anything touchy on the phone, or was winter break the last tough time?"

Carl didn't respond immediately. He picked up a 20-sided die, which he tossed back and forth as he thought back through the past few weeks. "I don't remember anything in particular coming up, so I guess Christmas time is the biggest problem I remember."

"Strange," Lindsay replied. "That's really strange because I felt like you didn't do anything really unusual over Christmas, at least as much as you told us."

"I know!", Carl exclaimed. 

After another silence, Drew cleared his throat. "Carl, I'm going to go out on a limb here. The disclaimer is that I don't know much about these sorts of things, and to be honest, I actually don't know a lot about you other than as our dungeon master."

"Noted," Carl replied. Drew paused again to formulate his thoughts.

"So she told you she feels 'trapped'. Being realistic, that's not that weird of a thing to have happen when you go off to college. You follow?" Carl nodded. "So maybe when you're talking online, it isn't a big deal, but when she comes home, then it sounded like you were trying to do her old favorite things. She probably has new favorite things at college, and maybe the oldies are reminders of things she maybe feels like she has moved past."

"Okay, that's fair," Carl said, "but I also tried offering to do new things that she's talked about. I just told you I was planning on going out to see her at college."

"Fine," Drew said. He looked over to the others, both of whom were also deeply immersed in his explanation. "I don't know much past debate and this game, so let's put it maybe in this context. I, as a player, can feel trapped in two different ways. One is if my character is in a prison or is otherwise repeatedly doing the same thing. That isn't a lot of fun, and perhaps characterizes one way a relationship could go if you keep rehasing the same old stuff.

"The other way to feel trapped is if you aren't making any decisions as things move forward. Maybe I'm overstepping the boundary between this game and your love life, but as DM, you're responsible for telling a story, and we're going to go off-script. There's a spectrum of ways for a DM to handle that, from ad libbing everything to railroading your players really hard back into the plot.

"So maybe Lindsay feels like you're railroading things for her. You seem very comfortable making calls and planning things, and maybe your campaign notes aren't what she wants."

Carl looked at Drew, and they held eye contact for awhile. Carl then slowly started to nod. "I guess that could make sense. Maybe you're right, maybe you're not, but you said it pretty convincingly."

Drew smiled with pride. "Remember that part where I said that my only skills are debate and this game? Well, the arguing was the debate part."

"Got it," Carl said. He reached out for a fist bump, which Drew returned. "Don't think you just fixed everything, but you at least gave me enough to think about that I won't just be lost, wallowing in my misery for the rest of the evening. So are you guys ready to start?"

"Yeah, if you are," Lindsay said. She reached over to pick up her character sheet.

"Cool. Well, let's pick up after you guys come back through the portal. Nice work getting through that last scenario everyone," Carl said. "You know, I was kind of uncertain how to make all of those checks work with the willpower thing and figuring out what modifiers you guys would get, but I think it worked out."

"I think so, too," Wayne said. "Nice job rolling with the punches and starting with half as many players as last time. I thought you transitioned things pretty smoothly."

"Thanks," Carl said. "So let's start back at the Sideways Tower. Presumably, this portal is more sane than some of the other ways you guys have gotten back here, so you can probably start on the doorstep again. What do you do?"
