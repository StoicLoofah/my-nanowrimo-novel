10. Shorthanded
===========================

"You said Drew isn't going to make it?" asked Carl.

"Yeah, he isn't doing so great," replied Lindsay. She pulled off the second of her boots and looked up at Carl. "You know how they had that big debate tournament at the beginning of the semester?" Carl nodded. "Well, Drew didn't do very well. Jimmy told me that it's pretty unlikely that Drew will qualify for state now."

"Woah, that's pretty grim. I bet he's not taking it well." They walked up the stairs together. "Hey Wayne, I don't think Drew is going to make it. He apparently didn't do so hot at the last debate tournament."

"Oh yikes," Wayne replied. He put his phone away and looked up at Drew and Lindsay. "Did his parents ground him?"

"He didn't say so at school," Lindsay replied. "They probably didn't need to. He looked terrible and probably grounded himself."

"Man, I feel terrible for him," said Wayne. "This was what he needed this season. Do you guys know what happened?"

"I heard he choked really badly," Lindsay said. She flopped down on the couch. "He was apparently crushing people in the early rounds, and he met a pretty well-known team and just completely fell apart."

"That's too bad," Carl said. "I was actualy going to put a really big focus on him for this adventure. I guess I'll need to retool some of this material for you guys. Maybe I got a little too psycho with him by focusing on his insecurity with this adventure."

Wayne idly spun his phone around in his hand. "It might have been good for him, if tough. I don't think you scared him off, per se," he said. The room was quiet again. "You don't look like you're doing so hot yourself."

Carl shook his head. "Things are not going well with Marie. I was pretty excited for her to come back for winter break, but we ended up actually seeing each other very much."

"But you two were inseparable before," Lindsay said. "Do you think she was avoiding you?"

"Definitely," he replied. "I asked her to do all of our usual things before: going to her favorite Chinese place, playing chess together against the computer, watching bad spaghetti westerns." He slouched down in his chair. "I just don't know how to talk to her anymore. She just seems so distant."

Lindsay nodded in agreement. "Maybe she's just changed too much since going off to college. I'm sure you both really enjoyed those things before, but maybe she's just not that into it anymore."

"Fair enough. I just feel like I can't do anything about the situation right now, and that's really frustrating." Carl looked off to the side, and the others kept quiet while he thought. "So," he started again, "I guess we should text Drew and see if he was planning on coming. Maybe he just forgot. Hannah decided not to finish up this adventure with us?" Carl asked.

"No, she wasn't able to make it this time," Wayne said. "I think she had a lot of fun, but she's pretty busy with school and didn't want to get sucked in it. She really enjoyed the role you gave her."

"I'm glad to hear that," Carl said. "Okay, I'll just take over the fairy then. I don't think I'll be able to be as peppy as she was, but I'll try. What's keeping her up? School work?"

"Not really," Wayne said. "Well, my mom isn't doing very well right now, so Hannah has been helping around the house a lot. I might have skipped, too, but she really insisted that I take the night off."

"That's really nice of her. I appreciate that you find time to play with us between school and work and everything." Wayne just nodded at Carl. Carl looked back and forth between them. "Is there any good news around here?"

"Well, the second regional meet went well," Lindsay added. "I think our math team has a lot of confidence going into the state competition."

"That is good news," Carl replied. "Congratulations. I hope all of your prep for that goes well."

"Speaking of prep, I haven't really come up with a plan for assaulting the castle," Lindsay said. "Wayne, did you think about it at all?"

"Nah." Wayne also shook his head.

"That's okay," Carl replied. "I wasn't really expecting you guys to do homework for our game. Besides, even if you had, you're short a person anyways, so it probably wouldn't have worked out. I'll try to jump in here and help you guys think through it.

"So right now, the party is outside of the castle. Let's say you guys are hiding behind a hill or something like that and peering in at the castle. What do you do?"
