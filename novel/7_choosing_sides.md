7. Choosing Sides
==================

"Hewman scummmm," the gnoll said. The words came out unnaturally and with a rumbling quality. "You come, you kill..."

"Hey, you started it!" yelled Darella. She tried to keep her stare on the gnoll speaking to her, but the suspending net slowly spun, and he left her sight until she came around again. "The dryads have done nothing to you, and yet you have been attacking them!"

The gnoll laughed, which caused the rest of the gnolls to pant in a agreement. "Hmmm? Is thattt what you hear? Lyhrfl will be verrry interested." He barked at a few other gnolls who slowly lowered the net down from a rope attached to a nearby tree. The gnolls took their equipment and bound their hands, then pushed them forward. The speaking gnoll led them deeper into the forest with a pack of guards for the party.

---

The walk was no more difficult for Dungeon Investigators, Inc. than usual. In fact, having their equipment removed made walking easier, it was largely indistinguishable from a normal walk through the forest.

"This actually works out pretty well," whispered Yannhorn to Darella. A gnoll jabbed him with a stick, but he keep talking. "We were planning on heading into gnoll territory, and this time, we even get an escort."

"Speak for yourself," replied Mareak, poking his head in. "I could do without the smell of gnolls." Mareak got a jab in the back for that comment, but the gnolls otherwise left them alone.

On their trek, they saw the more mundane side of gnoll life. They saw female gnolls who were tending to tents, mending weapons, and preparing food. 

"You know, I don't think I ever really considered that even gnolls have a home life," commented Mareak. "I guess the men spend all of their time catching wandering adventurers, and the women keep the men in top raiding shape. I wonder where the kids are, though."

"That's a really good question. And look at all of the damage," said Yannhorn. He pointed to a series of crushed huts where gnolls were picking through debris. "I guess gnoll domestic violence must be extra vicious. Yeow!," he screamed as a gnoll poked him again with a spear.

"Quiettt," the lead gnoll said as they slowed to a halt. "Be still," he said to them, and the other gnolls, weapons out, started to back away. When they had gotten a few feet away, a cage fell from above with a clang, trapping the party. The lead gnoll walked back up to them and banged on the metal cage with his axe. "Stay," he said, then walked away.

"Wait!" cried Mareak as he ran towards that side of the cage. "What's going to happen to us next?" The gnoll kept walking, and two other gnolls stepped up close to the cage to keep guard. "Do either of you know what's going on?," Mareak addressed them. One of the snarled at him, and Mareak backed away to the center of the cage with the others.

"I know what you're thinking: don't even try," said Darella, who slumped to the ground. "You can't sweet talk a creature who doesn't speak Common."

"How do you know that?" asked Mareak. "Our friends here could be very offended that you think so little of them."

"Only 1 in 50 speak Common, so you have a little under 4% chance of getting the smart ones," she replied. Mareak wrinkled his brow to think for a moment about that, then gave up and kicked at a clump of dirt on the ground.

"Well, if they don't speak Common, that means we can come up with an escape plan," said Yannhorn. "Can you turn into any useful shapes?"

"Not unless you think a bear can squeeze between these bars," said Darella. "Look, they haven't killed us yet, so we just have to hope for the best. Even if we did get out of here, we would still need our equipment to survive. I think we're best off just waiting to see what happens."

"Fine," said Yannhorn.

"Fine," said Mareak.

---

They waited in the cage until sundown, when a group of gnolls approached with torchlight. In the lead was a somewhat shorter gnoll, with a black mane and a white stripe running from his head down his back. He wore metal armor with a red insignia on the front of it. The whole party watched his approach in silence.

"Please forgive me for your treatment so far," he said in a deep, resonant voice without any guttural noises or typical gnoll-like qualities. "My name is Lyhrfl, and I am the chieftain of these gnolls. Welcome to our camp."

"Some welcome," said Darella. "Most welcomes don't involve prisons and traps. Well, except that one with the mad wizard who invited us over for dinner, but that doesn't count."

Lyhrfl paused, uncertain of how to respond. "Well, I have little to contribute to that point, but again, apologies. You adventurers tend to be feisty, and this seemed like the safest solution for everyone until I could convene with you.

"I will hazard a guess that you are here to kill me; I can't imagine that the three of you were eradicating all of us, and you certainly weren't here just for reconnaissance. Given that, I welcome you as my guests at dinner," he said. 

"What, are we dinner?" asked Yannhorn.

Lyhrfl laughed. "Oh no, young halfling. You shall dine with me at the main table. This is no trap. Please, come." He rose his paw, and the cage started to lift upwards.

"And you're severely outnumbered and constantly watched," Lyhrfl said. "I promise everything will be easier if you do not cause a commotion." He turned to walk away.

"Do we just go with it?" Yannhorn asked the others. 

"I think so," said Mareak. "I don't think disobeying is a survivable choice." Mareak follwed Lyhrfl, and the other two went after him.

"So Lyhrfl, I noticed that you speak Common without much of an accent. Consider me surprised," said Mareak.

"Well, that's because I'm actually a human in a gnoll's guise," Lyhrfl said looking over his shoulder.

"Hah. Wait, what?" Mareak squinted to take a close look at Lyhrfl in the dark, then a few of the gnolls laughed.

"I jest," Lyhrfl said without turning. "When I was young, we had a human prisoner with us. In exchange for his life, he agreed to teach me everything he knew about the human world. He gave me great appreciation for your cultures and languages, so I am here." Up ahead, they could see a large, well-lit tent.

"Clearly your 'appreciation' for humanity hasn't stopped your brutality against our communities or the dryads," Darella said derisively.

"Please, that talk can wait until after dinner," he replied. Lyhrfl held open the side of the tent opening and ushered them in. "For now, please enjoy."

Inside the tent were about 50 gnolls crouched at long tables. Although the tent itself was not decorated, the tables had elaborate spreads of meats and drinks. On the far side of the tent was a table on a raised platform, currently occupied by only a single gnoll. The air was filled with what sounded like a cacophony of barks, grunts, and growls, but the gnolls appeared to be enjoying themselves.

The party was led along the outside of the tent towards the platform. Although they were the only non-gnolls in the room, the others paid them no attention and continued to devour their meals. The party quietly sat on the platform at the low table in front of plates. As soon as they were all present, the one gnoll at the table dove into pile of meats in the middle of the table and began eating. Lyhrfl took his position and quickly began to do the same.

"Grace," said Yannhorn, and he stuck his fingers into the dishes and took his share onto his plate. He bit into a mouthful, then chewed for awhile. He swallowed and looked at the others who awaited his reaction.

"It's so-so," he said. They looked back skeptically at him. "Don't be rude. Dig in." He took a mouthful of a mashed potato-like glob and shoved that into his mouth.

The meal continued like this for a half-hour. There were clutches of conversation along the way, but the main focus was on eating, which Darella and Mareak took less enthuasiasm to. By the end, the table was clear of food, and drinks were being shared. 

Then, Lyhrfl stood and gave a loud bark, which quieted the rest of the tent. He began issuing a series of barks, which occasionally riled up the crowd, then quieted them. A few sentences in, a gnoll quietly approached the party's table.

"He speaksss to his tribe," the gnoll said in Common to the party. They all looked and listened, surprised to see their once captor and mortal combatant translating for them. "Praizzz for the hunters." He rattled off a series of names and accomplishments, some horrifying and some mundane. "Fun beginssss now," he finished as Lyhrfl finished, and he slinked away back to his table.

"Uh, fun?" Yannhorn looked at the gnolls, who were all howling at each other. This continued, but the sounds began to unify until all of the gnolls were crying one of two things. Then, Lyhrfl rose his paws into the air, and the howling stopped. In a flurry, the gnolls and tables cleared from the center of the tent, and two gnolls stepped into the middle.

"I think this is some kind of ritualistic combat," said Darella. She looked on as weapons were brought out into the middle of the tent, and each gnoll picked one: a handaxe and a spiked club.

"Well, this certainly isn't open mic night at the local tavern," said Yannhorn. The weapons were taken away, and the rest of the gnolls formed a circle around the two gnolls, who began to pace around the ring. 

Without warning, the gnoll with axe lept forward with the handaxe cocked behind his head and swung downward. The other gnoll rolled out of the way and put his club back up in a defensive position. They both reset into their previous positions and began to pace again. This happened several more times, each time quite suddenly.

"How long do these fights usually take?" asked Mareak.

"Long? They're just warming up," said Lyhrfl. "But we can hurry it along if you're getting bored." Lyhrfl slammed the table with an open paw, and the two fighters launched themselves at each other. Unlike their previously defensive and evasive moves, they began to heedlessly swing at each other, parrying only when necessary and hacking brutally into each other. Within a few seconds, the axe gnoll had knocked the other gnoll to the ground and held his axe up for the killing blow. 

And he waited.

"Okay, more updates please," Mareak requested.

"Grocn needs a champion," said Lyhrfl. "Or else he dies."

"Sure, I'll do it," said Mareak. He stood, got a running start off of the platform, and jumped into the middle of the ring.

The gnolls spoke quietly to each other in surprise.

"Woah, what are you doing?" Darella called out. "This isn't your fight."

Mareak looked at her and shrugged. "The numbers could be worse."

The axe gnoll lowered his axe and stepped back. The gnoll on the ground flipped onto his stomach and scampered back to the sideline. Mareak stood tall, watching the gnoll. Another gnoll came in, picked up the spiked club, and handed it to Mareak.

"Woah, woah, woah. I don't do clubs. I do daggers," said Mareak, hands on hips.

"This is not a choice," said Lyhrfl, "even for outsiders. Use it or not, but this is all you have to fight with."

"Okay, any other rules I should know about before I kick some butt?"

"No. Also, look up," Lyhrfl said.

Mareak turned to see the gnoll charging at him. Mareak sidestepped, then dropped his club low to the ground. The gnoll tripped on the club and went sprawling to the ground. Mareak brought his club around and swung it back down on the gnoll's back for a crushing blow.

The gnoll whimpered, then rolled away and got back to his feet. The crowd cheered, and a few paws reached out to the push the gnoll back towards the fight. Mareak smirked and waved his club around slowly in front of him. His opponent howled at him, then launched in for another attack.

Not coming full speed this time, the gnoll came with a series of rapid blows. Mareak did his best to parry with his club, but he felt awkward with the heavy weapon and had it knocked back and forth in his hands. The gnoll then came with another overhead cleave, and when Mareak held the club out to block it, it shattered, and he was knocked back and onto his butt.

The gnoll stood over him with the axe, ready to deliver the final swing. Darella and Yannhorn watched horrified about what might come, completely silent. Mareak was shocked by the turn of events, but when he looked down at his weapon, he saw a small, dagger-sized wood shard left in his hand. He looked back up at the gnoll, smiled, and dove forward.

Before the gnoll could react, Mareak stabbed at both of his legs and danced away. The gnoll tried to turn, but he found himself slowed by the cuts. Suddenly energized, Mareak moved quickly around the gnoll and made a series of stabs all around his body. The gnoll tried to swing his axe, but Mareak was too quick to be caught out of position and was already in a new place. Seconds later, Mareak held the gnoll with his left hand and had his club handle against the gnoll's neck.

"What's the gnoll word for 'mercy'?," he asked.

---

The party sat in Lyhrfl's personal tent with Lyhrfl and the other gnoll from the raised table who they had since learned was his wife. The ground was covered with a variety of rugs, and they lounged comfortably.

"That was amazingly bold," said Darella. "Really stupid, too, but I'm glad you made it." Mareak held his hand out for a high five, which Darella reluctantly gave him. 

"Bold move, indeed," Lyhrfl said with some admiration in his dark eyes. "You have earned much respect within the tribe in a short time. But we must talk as I feel as though I must convince you to act otherwise, or else I myself may lie dead in my own tent at the hands of an elf with a table leg.

"So I am open to you. Please, ask me what you will."

The party was caught offguard by his open-minded attitude and had not prepared questions. Darella jumped in first.

"Justify yourself. Despite your upbringing and knowledge, you continue to attack bordering communities and the dryads. You have exploited the absence of the druids, and your behavior has threatened the stability of the entire forest!" The room quickly became tense.

"Curious," Lyhrfl responded. "I would have thought that the druid of the group would best understand the importance of balance in this circumstance. Please, tell me honestly: do you think Folkwood would be better off with the gnolls gone?"

"Yes! How can the forest live in balance when you fight with the dryads, the only caretakers left?"

Lyhrfl nodded slowly, then turned to Yannhorn and Mareak. "Perhaps the two of you can provide the insight needed to understand this circumstance. Please, answer some questions for me. First, what did you see coming into our camp? Are we thriving?"

Darella glared at the other two, sensing betrayal coming, but remaining silent.

"No," said Yannhorn. "To be frank, it seemed like you guys are kind of in rough shape with the dilapidated huts."

"And what about the dryads? How are they doing?"

"They seem well," said Mareak. "They were very happy about how much their young were growing because of the Seed of–oops." He cut himself off. "I said nothing."

"No matter," said Lyhrfl. "If I didn't know of the Seed of Eternal Spring, you are right to be concerned. But the point is clear. Since the druids left, the dryads have fluorished, and we have suffered. If the druids were striving for balance, you can see in what direction they needed to push.

"Now, consider if the dryads had free rein and protection of the forest. How would that affect the humans?"

The party thought about this for a moment and had no answers.

"Well, here's a proposal for you," said Lyhrfl. "Accept my bias: the dryads would force the humans out, never allowing them to tap into the forest's resources. You can use your imagination as to how the Shermish king and politics may change were that to happen.

"And a final point: we do indeed raid human communities along the forest borders. What would happen if we were to stop?"

"They would grow stronger," said Mareak. "Without the threat of your attacks, the trappers and lumberjacks could be even more effective."

"Indeed. So perhaps you can see how delicate of a balance we have here," said Lyhrfl. Darella sat with her arms crossed looking away, but she was still listening.

"Okay, I think I get it," said Mareak. "So where do we come into this? Why explain all of this to us? Or is this some evil overlord thing where you tell us all of your secrets before planning to kill us?"

"Not at all," said Lyhrfl. "My proposal is simple: leave tomorrow at sunrise. Consider what you have heard and what you might do. Come back to us, and you will get what you present. The gnolls will be friends if you act as friends, but there will be no mercy should you threaten us again. Otherwise, choose your own path, and accept the consequences of your actions on yourselves, the gnolls, the dryads, the people, and the forest as a whole."

The fire cracked and popped in the corner while he looked seriously at all three. His wife remained silent but similarly stared to lend support to his point. After some thought, they began to talk again about other topics, and an hour later, they retired for the night. Lyhrfl sent for an escort to take them to their guarded tent. Yannhorn went to sleep, while Mareak sat awake for first watch. Darella tried to meditate, but found no peace in her thoughts.

---

Darella woke up the others at sunrise at the end of her watch. She had slept some during the middle of the night, but she was eager for the new day and a reason to be awake other than worry.

They stepped outside, where Lyhrfl's wife greeted them and brought clean water. The party talked briefly with her before she left to continue her usual chores.

"Again, we meet," they then heard a familiar voice call out. Their captor gnoll approached with several other gnolls who carried the party's gear. "Your thingz," he said, and they set the items in front of the party.

"Can we put them on?" Darella asked. The gnoll nodded, but pointed at the weapons and shook his head. A gnoll scooped those back up, but the party equipped themselves with the rest of it.

"Hey, I'm a little short on gold here," Mareak remarked as he checked through his sack. The gnoll gave him a toothy grin but said nothing.

"Hurry, we go," said the gnoll as they finished adjusting their armor. "Follow," he said and started walking away. Several other gnolls came up and prodded the party forward. They then began their walk back out of the gnoll camp.

They had walked for a half-hour in silence when Yannhorn broke the silence. "So what's your name?"

"Hard to say," the captor gnoll said. "Call me Bob."

"Pleasure to meet you formally, Bob," Yannhorn replied. "So Lyhrfl said he learned Common from a human prisoner. Did you learn Common from the same guy?"

"No," he replied. "Bob was prizzzoner. Learned fast from humanss..."

"Oh, I'm sorry to hear that." Yannhorn did his best to fake empathy with Bob. As they continued to walk, Yannhorn continued to chat with Bob and learned about Bob and gnoll culture. Although neither Mareak nor Darella spoke, they both eavesdropped with great interest. 

None of them knew what both Bob was leading them on until he pointed out the trap they had stepped onto just the day before. He laughed again and continued walking past it. Soon, Bob signaled for a stop and turned to address them.

"We done," he said. "Keep movving." He pointed forward, and the party nodded at him. Bob barked at the gnolls, and they turned around to head home.

Before they started moving, however, Bob sniffed a few times, then raised his hand for them to stop. He brought his axe to the ready position.

"What's up, Bob?" Yannhorn asked. Bob ignored him and took a few steps off to the side. He looked to be moving somewhat leisurely, then he swung his axe hard into a tree beside him.

The entire tree shook as Bob cut deep into its trunk. It's branches flailed, and the tree came to life and backed away from Bob. Bob also retreated back to the gnolls, and within seconds, the party saw a group of dryads assemble around them to face the gnolls.

"Leave now, and you can fight another day," said a dryad. Darella recognized the voice as Oakfoot's and looked to see him with his branches ready to fight. 

Bob snarled and signaled for his gnolls to prepare themselves.

"Wait!" cried Darella. "You don't have to fight! We can work this out!"

Bob looked squarely at Darella and spoke. "Then you have learned nothinggg..."

Bob launched himself forward towards the dryads, and his band of gnolls followed.

The fight began around the party, with branches being cut off and gnolls being thrown back. Darella tried to restrain a dryad, and Mareak tried to get himself between the fighters, but Yannhorn froze. Within a minute, the battle was over, and the gnolls lay dead across the forest floor. Several dryads stood wounded, but Oakfoot appeared to be unharmed.

"Take your things," said Oakfoot. "Let's go before more gnolls appear."

Darella and Mareak quickly grabbed their weapons. Yannhorn went take his, but his eyes wandered back to Bob, whose body was badly mangled a few feet away. He uttered a prayer to his god, then ran to catch up with the rest of the group.

---

"So you were unsuccessful," said Oakfoot. The party sat in the same spot as before, with the dryads near the Seed of Eternal Spring.

"Basically," said Mareak after noticing how quiet the other two were. "We were captured trying to make it into their camp, but as you saw, they let us go."

"How strange," said Oakfoot. He waved his branches back and forth in the air in an amusing manner, though Mareak guessed that it was probably just how dryads thought. "I wonder why they didn't just kill you."

Mareak shrugged. "I guess they figured that this wasn't our fight and gave us some leniency."

"This is quite unlike the gnolls," Oakfoot said. "You saw their savagery even when we offered to let them walk away." Oakfoot waved his branches with the wind again. Supressing a laugh, Mareak looked down at his feet and remained silent.

"We must think," Oakfoot concluded. "You may have set things into motion that cannot be stopped now, and the dryads will not be the victims. I think we may march on the gnolls, but wait here while we consider the matter." Oakfoot walked away, and the other dryads followed. They congregated around the Seed and began to speak in low, humming voices.

Mareak quickly rounded up the other two. "Yo, what's wrong with you guys? Can you help here? We have a Seed to cash in on."

"Yeah." Yannhorn narrowed his eyes and focused on the moment again. "Yeah, we do. Did you have a plan?"

"Other than just grab and run? Not really."

"Well, unless you're way better at sneaking than I think, you're not going to get it past that circle of dryads around it," said Yannhorn.

"Like I said: not really." Mareak looked at Darella who sat on a tree stump, staring into the distance. "Darella, you have a plan?"

"I don't even know what I want to have happen," she replied. "I feel like the 'right' thing to do is to let the dryads use the Seed to finish their campaign, but Lyhrfl has really gotten into my head."

"What, you think we should we should help the gnolls?" Mareak looked surprised. "I thought I was supposed to be the evil one here. Look, it seems clear that the easiest path is to let the dryads wipe out the gnolls, and we can just take the Seed when they're done."

"Really?" Yannhorn asked. "I thought it was pretty clear that the gnolls need our help. They're good guys. Okay, well they're actually bad guys, but they treated us great! How can we turn our backs on them? We have to get that Seed out of here soon."

"Fine," said Mareak. "Thank goddness there are three of us. Darella, your call: what do we do?"

Darella slumped forward and put her head in her hands. "I don't know. I don't know what I'm supposed to think right now."

Mareak rolled his eyes, threw his hands up in the air, and turned to walk away. However, he saw Oakfoot walking back towards them. He motioned for Darella and Yannhorn to pay attention.

"We march on the gnolls now," Oakfoot said. "Prepare yourself."

The party stood up to join the dryads congregating.

"Look," Mareak whispered to the others. He pointed at one of Oakfoot's branches. "He's carrying the seed. This is our chance."

---

The dryads marched in lockstep, causing the ground to rumble. The lead dryads made a whirring sound, which sounded vaguely like a warcry. The party followed closely behind without contending the plan.

They soon reached the same spot that they had fought the gnolls earlier, but this time, there were more. Several gnoll scouting parties had gathered around their dead comrades, and hearing the dryads approach, they readied themselves for another battle.

"You're outnumbered!" cried Oakfoot as the dryads approached in force. If any of the gnolls understood, they didn't reveal it as they growled and waved their spears and axes, beckoning the dryads to attack.

"This is an unlucky spot," mumbled Yannhorn. The dryads continued to march forward towards the gnolls, and when they were only paces away from the gnolls, the battle began.

The party joined the battle, knocking down but not killing any of the gnolls. The gnolls were indeed outnumbered, but they fought bravely against their massive, lumbering enemies. The Seed gave the dryads resilence in battle as they wounds seemed less deep, and the youngest of them fought with great strength.

A few minutes into the battle, Darella was fighting side-by-side with Oakfoot. "Oakfoot!" she cried. Oakfoot turned to look at her while swinging away with his branches. "I saw a gnoll running! I think he might warn the others! We have to catch him." Oakfoot nodded and disengaged with the battle. Darella ran off, and Oakfoot followed her away from the battle.

They ran for a few hundred yards before they reached a small clearing. Darella stopped and looked closely at the area around her.

"Which way?" Oakfoot asked. Darella walked slowly and carefully around the clearing.

"I'm not quite sure," she said. "I'm looking for clues." Oakfoot waited, raising and lowering his entire trunk as though to catch his breath. Darella came to the other side of the clearing, then looked back at Oakfoot. "This way, I think. Let's go."

Oakfoot nodded and crossed the clearing. As he stepped through the middle, however, he felt a string snap, and in a second, he was hoisted into the air in a net. He was surprised by the trap and dropped the Seed to the ground.

"What is this treachery?" he cried, trying to twist and turn his rigid body to look down at Darella, who sauntered back towards the middle and picked up the Seed.

"No treachery," she said. "I am only completing my predecessor's work and restoring balance to the forest. I hope you and the gnolls fluorish."

Darella ran back towards the battle that raged on. She found Mareak and Yannhorn fighting together.

"Guys, we should scoot _now_," she said.

"Now?" Yannhorn cried while knocking back a gnoll. "If you didn't notice, we're in a battle. And where have you been?"

"Finishing the quest. Mareak, you wanted my call? My call is that we're done. Now let's run." She took off away from the battle, away from the gnolls and dryads. Mareak and Yannhorn looked at each other, nodded, and followed.

---

"Okay, you have to explain: what made you make up your mind?," asked Mareak as they toasted each others' pints in the warmth of the Burned Skillet.

"I don't know," said Darella. "I thought long and hard about it, and I realized that I was thinking about it all wrong.

"For most people, making choices is all about taking sides. You pick the good or the bad, the law or the chaos, and you change things to suit your outcome. Just being in the battle, however, made me realize that the forest was fine until recently. The druid's side is no side: it's all about balance, and in this case, I guess the 'evil' needed some help, and the wined and dined us to make it happen."

"So your perfect outcome is to let the raids on communities continue and to let the gnolls and dryads duke it out for eternity?" Yannhorn asked. Darella looked deeply into her drink, then nodded. "Fine. I guess we got the Seed. That's balance enough for me."

Darella held her mug out for another toast, and they clinked their drinks again for another quest completed.
