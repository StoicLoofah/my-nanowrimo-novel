5. Finding 
=============================

The party woke up in the mid-morning when a server set down breakfast in their sitting room. Darella went out to meditate in a nearby park to recover her spells while Mareak and Yannhorn checked their gear and supplies. Within the hour, they headed out towards the sideways tower to hear the next part of their task.

The door and voice greeted them again on arrival and ushered them into the waiting room. Inside, they found Feenious in a haze of dust. He would rapidly take the top book off of a stack, leaf through the pages, then toss it over his shoulder. Whether by skill or magic, each book landed perfectly on another pile on the other side of the room.

"I think things turned out badly the last time we disrupted his research," said Mareak.

"Yeah, I think you have been turned into a chicken," guessed Darella. "Let's just sit down and let him finish." They all gingerly walked over to the couches, ducking when Feenious swung his arm to toss a book, and sat down to walk the rest of the action.

Yannhorn felt a slight tickle in his nose, which he tried to wipe away, but the dust in the room kept working. He warned the other, "This is going to be ba-achoo!"

Feenious was mid toss and threw the book off balance straight into Yannhorn's face. He turned to look at the other and raised his arms to cast a spell.

"No, no, no," yelled Darella as she ran up to him with her hands up to stop him. Feenious looked at her, then relaxed. He looked back at Yannhorn, then sighed.

"Your fault," he said unapologetically, then walked over to pick up the book and put it in its place. "You should have let me know you were here. What if you were a pack of thieves? Who knows what treasures they may have taken." At that moment, Mareak put a fancy piece of machinery back on the side table next to him.

Yannhorn rubbed his forehead then spoke. "Okay, so we're here like you asked us to be. What next horror do you have ready for us? Horse-sized ants?"

"Hah, no, that's ridiculous. Everyone knows that ants can only grow about as large as dogs." Feenious snapped his finger and a book shot out from a corner of the room into his hands. He flipped past a few pages and ran his finger down the page. "Still, here we are.

"As I mentioned last time, our confrontation with Malafar is near, and you must carry items with great energy from the material plane with you. It's hard to know exactly what the nature of these types of objects are, but I believe that one of them is quite near in the Folkwood Forest."

"Oh, I love Folkwood. The druid circle there is quite friendly," Darella said excitedly.

"Yeah, quite friendly to other druids. I remember spending an entire adventure in a cage trying to determine if the mouse in the cage with me was a polymorphed druid I was supposed to befriend, or just a mouse," lamented Yannhorn. 

"Well, I'm sorry you were unable to ascertain the purpose of that test," said Feenious with an amused grin. "Hopefully they will be more welcoming to you this time. Still, I do not believe that the druid circle itself possesses the item we are looking for, or else they would have come forward with it sooner. Do any of you happen to remember any items of importance from there?" Darella and Yannhorn shook their heads.

"Uh, was it that vase?" asked Mareak.

"No, I think that was in Stormhorn Province," replied Darella.

"I believe that the vase was from the labrynith, but that is neither here nor there," said Feenious. "But let's get back on track here. Well, if you don't remember anything, that's fine. I'm sure it will reveal itself."

"Payment?" asked Mareak.

"Maybe 400 gold pieces?" Mareak shrugged at this suggestion then look off to the side. "400 gold pieces, that clock sitting beside you, and a promise to forget your attempted larceny." Mareak gave him a toothy grin, nodded, and began quickly packing up.

"One more thing: be careful. I heard that there is trouble in the area. Reports are scarce, but that's all the more reason for caution."

Folkwood Forest was a 3 day walk from Ryden, and the party took it leisurely. Having done a mostly good job for various Shermish citizens, they had good company on the road and warm places to stay all along the way. The day before heading into the forest, they decided to stop early and rest at the Burned Skillet, an inn on the edge of Folkwood Forest.

"Oh my, is that Dungeon Investigators Inc. I see?" asked an old woman behind the desk, squinting through her glasses.

"Hi, Miranda. It's so good to see you again," said Mareak warmly. He walked over to the desk and gave her frail body a gentle hug. "Please tell me you have the heroes suite available right now." She winked at him and reached under the desk. She grabbed a keyring, jingled it, and handed it over to Mareak. "You're a saint, you know that? We're going to drop our things off in the room and come back down, and then you can tell me all about your grandchildren." The others picked up their gear and headed for the stairs with Mareak.

"You know," started Yannhorn, "one day, she is going to find out one day that her husband didn't die valiantly fighting at your side, and that you actually backstabbed him."

Mareak just shrugged and continued walking without a word.

After they had taken off their gear and rested their feet from the walk, they went back down for dinner, where meatloaf and ale were being served. Since the Burned Skillet was at a border, it attracted a variety of people: hunters from the forest, dwarves coming up the royal trade route, occasional more wild species, and everything in between. The party enjoyed many stories as the bard was out sick, and other patrons were taking turns on stage. The mood was generally festive, but the evening continued on, and by the end, the party was one of the few groups left, and they sat sipping their last pints in a corner with a ranger, Brendel.

"So you have told me many stories of your past journey, but not why you have come here now," Brendel observed. "Please, enlighten me."

The party, previously talkative and excited, turned serious with the question and looked at each other for guidance.

"No matter," said Brendel.
