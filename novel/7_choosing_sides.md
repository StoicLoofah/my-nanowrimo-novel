7. Choosing Sides
==================

"Hewman scummmm," the gnoll said. The words came out unnaturally and with a rumbling quality. "You come, you kill..."

"Hey, you started it!" yelled Darella. She tried to keep her stare on the gnoll speaking to her, but the suspending net slowly spun, and he left her sight until she came around again. "The dryads have done nothing to you, and yet you have been attacking them!"

The gnoll laughed, which caused the rest of the gnolls to pant in a agreement. "Hmmm? Is thattt what you hear? Lyhrfl will be verrry interested." He barked at a few other gnolls who slowly lowered the net down from a rope attached to a nearby tree. The gnolls took their equipment and bound their hands, then pushed them forward. The speaking gnoll led them deeper into the forest with a pack of guards for the party.

The walk was no more difficult for Dungeon Investigators, Inc. than usual. In fact, having their equipment removed made walking easier, it was largely indistinguishable from a normal walk through the forest.

"This actually works out pretty well," whispered Yannhorn to Darella. A gnoll jabbed him with a stick, but he keep talking. "We were planning on heading into gnoll territory, and this time, we even get an escort."

"Speak for yourself," replied Mareak, poking his head in. "I could do without the smell of gnolls." Mareak got a jab in the back for that comment, but the gnolls otherwise left them alone.

On their trek, they saw the more mundane side of gnoll life. They saw female gnolls who were tending to tents, mending weapons, and preparing food. 

"You know, I don't think I ever really considered that even gnolls have a home life," commented Mareak. "I guess the men spend all of their time catching wandering adventurers, and the women keep the men in top raiding shape. I wonder where the kids are, though."

"That's a really good question. And look at all of the damage," said Yannhorn. He pointed to a series of crushed huts where gnolls were picking through debris. "I guess gnoll domestic violence must be extra vicious. Yeow!," he screamed as a gnoll poked him again with a spear.

"Quiettt," the lead gnoll said as they slowed to a halt. "Be still," he said to them, and the other gnolls, weapons out, started to back away. When they had gotten a few feet away, a cage fell from above with a clang, trapping the party. The lead gnoll walked back up to them and banged on the metal cage with his axe. "Stay," he said, then walked away.

"Wait!" cried Mareak as he ran towards that side of the cage. "What's going to happen to us next?" The gnoll kept walking, and two other gnolls stepped up close to the cage to keep guard. "Do either of you know what's going on?," Mareak addressed them. One of the snarled at him, and Mareak backed away to the center of the cage with the others.

"I know what you're thinking: don't even try," said Darella, who slumped to the ground. "You can't sweet talk a creature who doesn't speak Common."

"How do you know that?" asked Mareak. "Our friends here could be very offended that you think so little of them."

"Only 1 in 50 speak Common, so you have a little under 4% chance of getting the smart ones," she replied. Mareak wrinkled his brow to think for a moment about that, then gave up and kicked at a clump of dirt on the ground.

"Well, if they don't speak Common, that means we can come up with an escape plan," said Yannhorn. "Can you turn into any useful shapes?"

"Not unless you think a bear can squeeze between these bars," said Darella. "Look, they haven't killed us yet, so we just have to hope for the best. Even if we did get out of here, we would still need our equipment to survive. I think we're best off just waiting to see what happens."

"Fine," said Yannhorn.

"Fine," said Mareak.

They waited in the cage until sundown, when a group of gnolls approached with torchlight. In the lead was a somewhat shorter gnoll, with a black mane and a white stripe running from his head down his back. He wore metal armor with a red insignia on the front of it. The whole party watched his approach in silence.

"Please forgive me for your treatment so far," he said in a deep, resonant voice without any guttural noises or typical gnoll-like qualities. "My name is Lyhrfl, and I am the chieftain of these gnolls. Welcome to our camp."

"Some welcome," said Darella. "Most welcomes don't involve prisons and traps. Well, except that one with the mad wizard who invited us over for dinner, but that doesn't count."

Lyhrfl paused, uncertain of how to respond. "Well, I have little to contribute to that point, but again, apologies. You adventurers tend to be feisty, and this seemed like the safest solution for everyone until I could convene with you.

"I will hazard a guess that you are here to kill me; I can't imagine that the three of you were eradicating all of us, and you certainly weren't here just for reconnaissance. Given that, I welcome you as my guests at dinner," he said. 

"What, are we dinner?" asked Yannhorn.

Lyhrfl laughed. "Oh no, young halfling. You shall dine with me at the main table. This is no trap. Please, come." He rose his paw, and the cage started to lift upwards.

"And you're severely outnumbered and constantly watched," Lyhrfl said. "I promise everything will be easier if you do not cause a commotion." He turned to walk away.

"Do we just go with it?" Yannhorn asked the others. 

"I think so," said Mareak. "I don't think disobeying is a survivable choice." Mareak follwed Lyhrfl, and the other two went after him.

"So Lyhrfl, I noticed that you speak Common without much of an accent. Consider me surprised," said Mareak.

"Well, that's because I'm actually a human in a gnoll's guise," Lyhrfrl said looking over his shoulder.

"Hah. Wait, what?" Mareak squinted to take a close look at Lyhrfl in the dark, then a few of the gnolls laughed.

"I jest," Lyhrfl said without turning. "When I was young, we had a human prisoner with us. In exchange for his life, he agreed to teach me everything he knew about the human world. He gave me great appreciation for your cultures and languages, so I am here." Up ahead, they could see a large, well-lit tent.

"Clearly your 'appreciation' for humanity hasn't stopped your brutality against our communities or the dryads," Darella said derisively.

"Please, that talk can wait until after dinner," he replied. Lyhrfl held open the side of the tent opening and ushered them in. "For now, please enjoy."

Inside the tent were about 50 gnolls crouched at long tables. Although the tent itself was not decorated, the tables had elaborate spreads of meats and drinks. On the far side of the tent was a table on a raised platform, currently occupied by only a single gnoll. The air was filled with what sounded like a cacophony of barks, grunts, and growls, but the gnolls appeared to be enjoying themselves.

The party was led along the outside of the tent towards the platform. Although they were the only non-gnolls in the room, the others paid them no attention and continued to devour their meals. The party quietly sat on the platform at the low table in front of plates. As soon as they were all present, the one gnoll at the table dove into pile of meats in the middle of the table and began eating. Lyhrfl took his position and quickly began to do the same.

"Grace," said Yannhorn, and he stuck his fingers into the dishes and took his share onto his plate. He bit into a mouthful, then chewed for awhile. He swallowed and looked at the others who awaited his reaction.

"It's so-so," he said. They looked back skeptically at him. "Don't be rude. Dig in." He took a mouthful of a mashed potato-like glob and shoved that into his mouth.

The meal continued like this for a half-hour. There were clutches of conversation along the way, but the main focus was on eating, which Darella and Mareak took less enthuasiasm to. By the end, the table was clear of food, and drinks were being shared. 

Then, Lyhrfl stood and gave a loud bark, which quieted the rest of the tent. He began issuing a series of barks, which occasionally riled up the crowd, then quieted them. A few sentences in, a gnoll quietly approached the party's table.

"He speaksss to his tribe," the gnoll said in Common to the party. They all looked and listened, surprised to see their once captor and mortal combatant translating for them. "Praizzz for the hunters." He rattled off a series of names and accomplishments, some horrifying and some mundane. "Fun beginssss now," he finished as Lyhrfl finished, and he slinked away back to his table.

"Uh, fun?" Yannhorn looked at the gnolls, who were all howling at each other. This continued, but the sounds began to unify until all of the gnolls were crying one of two things. Then, Lyhrfl rose his paws into the air, and the howling stopped. In a flurry, the gnolls and tables cleared from the center of the tent, and two gnolls stepped into the middle.

"I think this is some kind of ritualistic combat," said Darella. She looked on as weapons were brought out into the middle of the tent, and each gnoll picked one: a handaxe and a spiked club.

"Well, this certainly isn't open mic night at the local tavern," said Yannhorn. The weapons were taken away, and the rest of the gnolls formed a circle around the two gnolls, who began to pace around the ring. 

Without warning, the gnoll with axe lept forward with the handaxe cocked behind his head and swung downward. The other gnoll rolled out of the way and put his club back up in a defensive position. They both reset into their previous positions and began to pace again. This happened several more times, each time quite suddenly.

"How long do these fights usually take?" asked Mareak.

"Long? They're just warming up," said Lyhrfl. "But we can hurry it along if you're getting bored." Lyhrfl slammed the table with an open paw, and the two fighters launched themselves at each other. Unlike their previously defensive and evasive moves, they began to heedlessly swing at each other, parrying only when necessary and hacking brutally into each other. Within a few seconds, the axe gnoll had knocked the other gnoll to the ground and held his axe up for the killing blow. 

And he waited.

"Okay, more updates please," Mareak requested.

"Grocn needs a champion," said Lyhrfl. "Or else he dies."

"Sure, I'll do it," said Mareak. He stood, got a running start off of the platform, and jumped into the middle of the ring.

The gnolls spoke quietly to each other in surprise.

"Woah, what are you doing?" Darella called out. "This isn't your fight."

Mareak looked at her and shrugged. "The numbers could be worse."

The axe gnoll lowered his axe and stepped back. The gnoll on the ground flipped onto his stomach and scampered back to the sideline. Mareak stood tall, watching the gnoll. Another gnoll came in, picked up the spiked club, and handed it to Mareak.

"Woah, woah, woah. I don't do clubs. I do daggers," said Mareak, hands on hips.

"This is not a choice," said Lyhrfl, "even for outsiders. Use it or not, but this is all you have to fight with."

"Okay, any other rules I should know about before I kick some butt?"

"No. Also, look up," Lyhrfl said.

Mareak turned to see the gnoll charging at him. Mareak sidestepped, then dropped his club low to the ground. The gnoll tripped on the club and went sprawling to the ground. Mareak brought his club around and swung it back down on the gnoll's back for a crushing blow.

The gnoll whimpered, then rolled away and got back to his feet. The crowd cheered, and a few paws reached out to the push the gnoll back towards the fight. Mareak smirked and waved his club around slowly in front of him. His opponent howled at him, then launched in for another attack.

Not coming full speed this time, the gnoll came with a series of rapid blows. Mareak did his best to parry with his club, but he felt awkward with the heavy weapon and had it knocked back and forth in his hands. The gnoll then came with another overhead cleave, and when Mareak held the club out to block it, it shattered, and he was knocked back and onto his butt.

The gnoll stood over him with the axe, ready to deliver the final swing. Darella and Yannhorn watched horrified about what might come, completely silent. Mareak was shocked by the turn of events, but when he looked down at his weapon, he saw a small, dagger-sized wood shard left in his hand. He looked back up at the gnoll, smiled, and dove forward.

Before the gnoll could react, Mareak stabbed at both of his legs and danced away. The gnoll tried to turn, but he found himself slowed by the cuts. Suddenly energized, Mareak moved quickly around the gnoll and made a series of stabs all around his body. The gnoll tried to swing his axe, but Mareak was too quick to be caught out of position and was already in a new place. Seconds later, Mareak held the gnoll with his left hand and had his club handle against the gnoll's neck.

"What's the gnoll word for 'mercy'?," he asked.
