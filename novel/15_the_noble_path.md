15. The Noble Path
==================

Dungeons Investigators Inc. hid behind the barrels as the guard walked down the steps. The door closed behind him.

"What a mess," the guard cried in a gruff voice as he looked at the rice and fish on the ground. "That's the last time we try to use this as bonus storage space."

"Shang, my friend," the prisoner said. "What delights do you bring me for dinner tonight?"

"Shaddup and take your food," the guard said. He opened a slot on the floor and pushed the bowl through.

"With pleasure," the prisoner said, snatching the food from the ground. He devoured it as the guard walked back up the steps. At the top of the steps, the guard tapped "shave and a haircut" on the door. The door creaked against as it was unlocked. Before the guard could walk through, Mareak kicked over the barrel of rice.

"What was that?" the guard exclaimed as he turned to look into the darkness. He motioned for the door to be closed, then cautiously walked back down, sword in hand. "Who's there?"

Just when the guard stepped in front of Mareak, he struck. With one hand, he brought forth a cloth over the guard's mouth, and with the other, he stabbed into a gap in his armor. With his numb hand, however, he had difficulty getting the cloth over, and the guard let out a scream. Yannhorn and Darella quickly joined in and subdued the guard.

"That was close," Yannhorn whispered. Mareak nodded and began to remove the guard's armor and don it himself. He worked quickly with the help of Yannhorn and Darella and was suited up roughly in his size. He pulled the helmet down close on his head and tried to tuck his pointy ears back as best as he could. Getting the thumbs up from the others, he walked up the stairs and up to the door. He knocked "shave and a haircut" into the door and waited.

The door didn't immediately open, and Mareak become uneasy. Just as he was thinking about of a new plan, he heard the sound of the door being unbarred. The door swung open, and in front of Mareak stood 12 guards.

"Abort!" he cried as he flung himself off of the stairs and landed on the dungeon floor beneath. The guards swarmed into the dungeon and attacked.

In the dark, Dungeon Investigators Inc. had the advantage. While the human guards could see little in darkness, elves and halflings have infravision, which Yannhorn and Mareak took full advantage of. The guards swung wildly into the flickering shadows and silhouettes in front of them while the adventurers attacked fiercely. Even Darella, whose eyes had fully adjusted, found herself comfortable against mostly blind foes.

"I need a way out!" Mareak called
